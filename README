    make -C web2w
    mv web2w/tex.w ctex.w
    cp tex.w utex.w
    <rm reverse check of mbtowc() from utex.w>
    diff -u ctex.w utex.w >utex.patch # ("mapping" file is used with it)
    rm ctex.w utex.w

web2w.w change is necessary only for terminal output.
Also, *.ch files are merged to tex.ch with ctie.
I don't use kpathsea because it is too complicated - I use absolute path to
TeXinputs and add symlinks to necessary files in it.
