See utf8.pdf - it contains improvements to https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb41-3/tb129liferenko-utf8.pdf

Add this `tex' script to PATH:

    #!/bin/sh
    /path/to/tex/plain "$@"
    ret=$?
    [ $ret != 134 ] && echo
    exit $ret

To use debugger, add "-g -Og" and run "gdb plain"
Use this change-file to make stepping over this line with `n' command faster:
@x
for (i=first_text_char; i<=last_text_char; i++) xord[chr(i)]=invalid_code;
@y
memset(xord, invalid_code, sizeof xord);
@z

Add this change to beginning of web2w/printable.ch if you need to
use (part of) extended character set from Appendix C of TeXbook
to avoid this CTANGLE error:
    ! This can't happen: macro defs have strange char
@x
  else wput(k);
@y
  else if (k<' ') fprintf(w,"\\x%x",k);
  else wput(k);
@z

Change CWEBINPUTS in Makefile and web2w/Makefile to point to
directory where mapping.w is stored:

    https://github.com/igor-liferenko/cweb

Compile ctangle and wmerge from:

    http://ftp.cs.stanford.edu/pub/cweb/cweb-3.64ah.tgz

using common.patch and ctangle.patch from:

    https://w3-o.cs.hm.edu/users/ruckert/public_html/web2w/web2w.tgz

Change-files are for Linux; `em' editor is needed:

    https://github.com/igor-liferenko/em

If you do not have flex and bison, just comment `make -C web2w' in Makefile
(in such case you will not be able to run the TRIP test)
