After initial import:

    sed -i 's/ \+$//' tex.w ctex.patch

After processing with modified web2w.w:

    sed -i 's/ \+$//' tex.w
    perl -i -pe 's/@d str_(\d+) L"/@d str_$1 "/' tex.w

Then make ctex.patch apply to new tex.w

Then change tex.w to add UTF-8 support and change ctex.patch accordingly.
