    make -C web2w
    mv web2w/tex.w ctex.w
    cp tex.w utex.w
    diff -u ctex.w utex.w >utex.patch
    rm ctex.w utex.w
Now utex.patch cat be applied to ctex.w, generated using web2w.ch
"mapping" file is used with it.
Also, tex.ch is created from *.ch files with `tie'.
I don't use kpathsea because I don't need it - I use absolute path to
TeXinputs (see path.ch) and add symlinks to necessary files in it.

Limitations:
1. You can't use non-ascii characters in paths to fonts, formats and inputs (see comment after `bufntombslen'). But it easily fixed with symlinks.
2. You can't use "extended character set" (because in editor and in terminal such characters can't be displayed).

libc6 ver 2.30 is needed
