    make -C web2w
    mv web2w/tex.w ctex.w
    cp tex.w utex.w
    diff -u ctex.w utex.w >utex.patch
    rm ctex.w utex.w

Limitations:
1. You can't use non-ascii characters in paths to fonts, formats and inputs (see comment after `bufntombslen'). If you need to have non-ascii characters in the name of such a directory, create ascii symlink to it.
2. You can't use "extended character set" (because in editor and in terminal such characters can't be displayed).
