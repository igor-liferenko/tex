    make -C web2w
    mv web2w/tex.w ctex.w
    cp tex.w utex.w
    diff -u ctex.w utex.w >utex.patch
    rm ctex.w utex.w
Now utex.patch cat be applied to ctex.w, generated using printable.ch
"mapping" file is used with it.

Limitations:
1. You can't use non-ascii characters in paths to fonts, formats and inputs (see comment after `bufntombslen'). But it easily fixed with symlinks.
2. You can't use "extended character set" (because in editor and in terminal such characters can't be displayed).
3. You can't use non-ascii cheracters in \special (TeX writes dvi files in internal encoding; circumventing this violates the TRIP test).
