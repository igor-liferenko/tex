To use debugger, compile with "-g -Og" flags and run "gdb plain"
NOTE: when optimization is enabled, "ceil" and "floor" (used in "round")

Use this change-file to make stepping over this line with `n' command faster:
@x
for (i=first_text_char; i<=last_text_char; i++) xord[chr(i)]=invalid_code;
@y
memset(xord, invalid_code, sizeof xord);
@z

Add this change to beginning of web2w/printable.ch if you need to
use (part of) extended character set from Appendix C of TeXbook
to avoid this CTANGLE error:
    ! This can't happen: macro defs have strange char
@x
  else wput(k);
@y
  else if (k<' ') fprintf(w,"\\x%x",k);
  else wput(k);
@z
