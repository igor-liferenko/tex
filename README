    make -C web2w
    mv web2w/tex.w ctex.w
    cp tex.w utex.w
    <rm reverse check of mbtowc() from utex.w>
    diff -u ctex.w utex.w >utex.patch
    rm ctex.w utex.w
Now utex.patch cat be applied to ctex.w from
    https://w3-o.cs.hm.edu/users/ruckert/public_html/web2w/
"mapping" file is used with it.
web2w.w change is necessary only for terminal output.
Also, tex.ch is created from *.ch files with `tie'.
I don't use kpathsea because it is too complicated - I use absolute path to
TeXinputs and add symlinks to necessary files in it.
