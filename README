"mapping" file is used with it.

Limitations:
1. You can't use non-ascii characters in paths to fonts, formats and inputs (see comment after `bufntombslen'). If you need to have non-ascii characters in the name of such a directory, create ascii symlink to it.
2. You can't use "extended character set" (because in editor and in terminal such characters can't be displayed).
3. You can't use non-ascii characters in \special (TeX writes dvi files in internal encoding; circumventing this violates the TRIP test). For "psfile" you can do it via dvips's `-feature using a script which does the conversion via "mapping" file (but the script name must be ascii, e.g., `map').
4. Filenames can't contain spaces (see first condition in more_name()).
