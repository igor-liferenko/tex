To get changes to ctex.w, do

    make -C web2w # to produce modified ctex.w (but ctex.patch applies cleanly; afterwards str_0_255 is factored out from it)
    diff tex.w web2w/tex.w # (the latter tex.w is in fact ctex.w; the former tex.w is in fact utex.w)

To get changes to web2w.w, do diff of web2w/web2w.w with web2w.w from CTAN;
the same for ctangle.patch and common.patch
