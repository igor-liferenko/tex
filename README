UTF-8 changes can be seen as follows:
  make -C web2w
  diff -u web2w/tex.w tex.w
(if you need a new mapping, regenerate tex.w using these changes on web2w/tex.w, obtained
using the new mapping)

Recent version of glibc must be used (otherwise you may get "Segmentation fault" errors).

It is assumed that this repo is in /home/user.

For MetaPost add 'TEX = tex' to texmf.cnf
