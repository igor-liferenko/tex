`wterm_cr' is used in `exit' because newline was automatically printed on PDP-10 (where TeX was created) after program exit. Incidentally, the way how final newline in TL's tex is done is redundant (it is fixed in many places instead of one (as my) - after "why?" and "transcript written", and they should have fixed it also after inputting "q", but they didn't).
(In answer #6 [1] is meant the <return> produced by print_ln() which goes right after printing '...' - not the final <return> before shell prompt.)
