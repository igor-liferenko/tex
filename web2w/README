Based on web2w 4.0 from ctan, except:

1) This is added to ctex.patch:

    +#define abs(X)       ((X)>-(X)?(X):-(X))
    +#define round(X)     ((int)((X)>=0.0?floor((X)+0.5):ceil((X)-0.5)))

NOTE: '#define round' is used in order not to use -lm gcc option (math.h),
but for this gcc optimization option must be used, which makes gcc
use built-in versions of floor() and ceil().
And -O option is used by web2w author and -lm option is not used - see
web2w.pdf on ctan and in this directory.

2) This is added to web2w.w ('register' is a reserved word in C):

    SYM_PTR("register")->name="internal_register";

TODO:
1) check if section from printable.ch is the same as in web2w.pdf in this directory
and on ctan and if yes, delete web2w.pdf from this directory
2) find out if '#define abs' and '#define round' mentioned above can be deleted from
tex,mf,dvitype,gftodvi,gftopk repos
round = math.h
abs = stdlib.h
3) use web.l and pascal.y and web2w.w from ctan (except internal_register change
mentioned above) in tex,mf,dvitype,gftodvi,gftopk repos
