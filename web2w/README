Based on web2w 4.0 from ctan, except:

1) This is added to ctex.patch:

    +#define abs(X)       ((X)>-(X)?(X):-(X))
    +#define round(X)     ((int)((X)>=0.0?floor((X)+0.5):ceil((X)-0.5)))

NOTE: default abs (stdlib.h) is for inegers only and it truncates floating values

NOTE: in section 3 of tex.pdf it is said that Pascal's 'round' function
disagrees with the IEEE
floating-point standard and that many implementors have therefore chosen
to substitute their own home-grown
rounding procedure.
But maybe the reason is simply that 'floor' and 'ceil' were built-in in author's compiler and he decided
to define his own 'round' because gcc invocation from web2w.pdf
does not have -lm option
TODO: cmp definition of round in math.h and if it is the same, delete '#define round' from
tex,mf,dvitype,gftodvi,gftopk repos

2) This is added to web2w.w ('register' is a reserved word in C):

    SYM_PTR("register")->name="internal_register";

TODO:
1) check if section from printable.ch is the same as in web2w.pdf in this directory
and on ctan and if yes, delete web2w.pdf from this directory
2) use web.l and pascal.y and web2w.w from ctan (adding internal_register change
mentioned above) in tex,mf,dvitype,gftodvi,gftopk repos

TODO:
put all changes directly to ctex.patch from c.patch, tex.patch and sed (see web2w/Makefile)
and change utf8.tex in accordance with 2021 tuneup if necessary
