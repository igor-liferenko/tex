Why this is added to ctex.patch:

    +#define abs(X)       ((X)>-(X)?(X):-(X))
    +#define round(X)     ((int)((X)>=0.0?floor((X)+0.5):ceil((X)-0.5)))

NOTE: default abs (stdlib.h) is for inegers only and it truncates floating values

NOTE: in section 3 of tex.pdf it is said that Pascal's 'round' function
disagrees with the IEEE
floating-point standard and that many implementors have therefore chosen
to substitute their own home-grown
rounding procedure.
But maybe the reason is simply that 'floor' and 'ceil' were built-in in author's compiler and he decided
to define his own 'round' because gcc invocation from web2w.pdf
does not have -lm option
TODO: cmp definition of round in math.h and if it is the same, delete '#define round' from
tex,mf,dvitype,gftodvi,gftopk repos

============================

NOTE: --no-backup-if-mismatch is used in Makefile in order to make less changes to ctex.patch
      (so that it is easier to see how ctex.patch differs from original)

TODO:
change utf8.tex in accordance with 2021 tuneup if necessary

TODO:
do like this for month in ctex.patch
