understand why editor bug in TeX tuneup 2021 does not affect my implementation
HINT: restore opening via file name from `git diff dfd5b8172..64cf8753e8', deactivate print.ch
      and check again (also remove the following code from tex.web)
if name=str_ptr-1 then {we can conserve string pool space now}
  begin flush_string; name:=cur_name;
  end;

=== 2021 tuneup (can be undone by removing everything starting from first `;' in sed-command and changing tex-2021.web to tex.web in web2w/Makefile, removing time.ch and changing "sed '...'" to "cat" in Makefile) ===

NOTE: the following changes are not relevant to me:

+Beware: For historic reasons, this code foolishly conserves a tiny bit
+of string pool space; but that can confuse the interactive `\.E' option.
+@^system dependencies@>

-if name=str_ptr-1 then {we can conserve string pool space now}
+if name=str_ptr-1 then {conserve string pool space (but see note above)}

This is because I do not use string pool to obtain file name for editor.
String pool cannot be used for the following reasons:
1) before being used for editor, file name from string pool is printed on terminal and in log
2) we need to modify file name before it is being printed (see print.ch); after it is printed, its string pool space is conserved (only files being \input are subject to this - string pool space of
master file is never conserved (this is because x.tex is followed by x.log in string pool and the
"if" check is therefore false))
3) after it is modified, file name cannot be used for editor
So no need to keep it - let string pool space be conserved.
Luckily, there is an alternative method to obtain file name - using file descriptor.
