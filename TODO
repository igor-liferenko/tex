understand why editor bug in TeX tuneup 2021 does not affect my implementation
HINT: restore opening via file name from `git diff dfd5b8172..64cf8753e8', deactivate print.ch
      and check again (also remove the following code from tex.web)
if name=str_ptr-1 then {we can conserve string pool space now}
  begin flush_string; name:=cur_name;
  end;

=== 2021 tuneup (commits 1dddef..ad17c3 + 1c1eb7) ===
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
NOTE: the following changes are not relevant to me:

+Beware: For historic reasons, this code foolishly conserves a tiny bit
+of string pool space; but that can confuse the interactive `\.E' option.
+@^system dependencies@>

-if name=str_ptr-1 then {we can conserve string pool space now}
+if name=str_ptr-1 then {conserve string pool space (but see note above)}

This is because I do not use string pool to obtain file name for editor.
String pool cannot be used for the following reasons:
1) before being used for editor, file name from string pool is printed on terminal and in log
2) we need to modify file name before it is being printed (see print.ch); after it is printed, its string pool space is conserved (only files being \input are subject to this - string pool space of
master file is never conserved (this is because x.tex is followed by x.log in string pool and the
"if" check is therefore false))
3) after it is modified, file name cannot be used for editor
So no need to keep it - let string pool space be conserved.
Luckily, there is an alternative method to obtain file name - using file descriptor.

This change is suspicious:

-This program doesn't bother to close the input files that may still be open.
+If |final_cleanup| is bypassed, this program doesn't bother to close
+the input files that may still be open.

(it seems input files are not closed in final_cleanup either - check this by analogy with commit
5efca0dac55b1da2912cba599f4c
(segfault manifested itself when program exited before wide-oriented file was explicitly closed in old libc on debian 10 buster - in debian 11 it works ok). Try to understand
if the method used in 5efca0 commit is similar to how this
    https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-k/2018-February/002851.html
was resolved in
    https://github.com/nadder/rstex/ (by assigning NULL)
But this exact problem from pipermail link is not relevant to web2w implementation because it does
not use string pool file.
