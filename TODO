(but output in TeXbook may differ then)

understand why editor bug in TeX tuneup 2021 does not affect my implementation
HINT: restore opening via file name from `git diff dfd5b8172..64cf8753e8', deactivate print.ch
      and check again (also remove the following code from tex.web)
if name=str_ptr-1 then {we can conserve string pool space now}
  begin flush_string; name:=cur_name;
  end;

Update to 2021 tuneup.

NOTE: the following changes are not relevant to me:

+Beware: For historic reasons, this code foolishly conserves a tiny bit
+of string pool space; but that can confuse the interactive `\.E' option.
+@^system dependencies@>

-if name=str_ptr-1 then {we can conserve string pool space now}
+if name=str_ptr-1 then {conserve string pool space (but see note above)}

This is because I do not use string pool to obtain file name for editor.
String pool cannot be used for the following reasons:
1) before being used for editor, file name from string pool is printed on terminal and in log
2) we need to modify file name before it is being printed (see print.ch)
3) after it is modified, file name cannot be used for editor
So no need to keep it - let it be removed by default.
Luckily, there is an alternative method to obtain file name - using file descriptor.

This is suspicious:

-This program doesn't bother to close the input files that may still be open.
+If |final_cleanup| is bypassed, this program doesn't bother to close
+the input files that may still be open.

(it seems input files are not closed in final_cleanup either - check this - see commit

(manifested itself in old libc on debian 10 buster - in debian 11 it works ok), also see
