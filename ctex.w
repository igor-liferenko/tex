@* Introduction.
This is \TeX, a document compiler intended to produce typesetting of high
quality.
The \PASCAL\ program that follows is the definition of \TeX82, a standard
@:PASCAL}{\PASCAL@>
@!@:TeX82}{\TeX82@>
version of \TeX\ that is designed to be highly portable so that identical output
will be obtainable on a great variety of computers.

The main purpose of the following program is to explain the algorithms of \TeX\
as clearly as possible. As a result, the program will not necessarily be very
efficient when a particular \PASCAL\ compiler has translated it into a
particular machine language. However, the program has been written so that it
can be tuned to run efficiently in a wide variety of operating environments
by making comparatively few changes. Such flexibility is possible because
the documentation that follows is written in the \.{WEB} language, which is
at a higher level than \PASCAL; the preprocessing step that converts \.{WEB}
to \PASCAL\ is able to introduce most of the necessary refinements.
Semi-automatic translation to other languages is also feasible, because the
program below does not make extensive use of features that are peculiar to
\PASCAL.

A large piece of software like \TeX\ has inherent complexity that cannot
be reduced below a certain level of difficulty, although each individual
part is fairly simple by itself. The \.{WEB} language is intended to make
the algorithms as readable as possible, by reflecting the way the
individual program pieces fit together and by providing the
cross-references that connect different parts. Detailed comments about
what is going on, and about why things were done in certain ways, have
been liberally sprinkled throughout the program.  These comments explain
features of the implementation, but they rarely attempt to explain the
\TeX\ language itself, since the reader is supposed to be familiar with
{\sl The \TeX book}.
@.WEB@>
@:TeXbook}{\sl The \TeX book@>

@ The present implementation has a long ancestry, beginning in the summer
of~1977, when Michael~F. Plass and Frank~M. Liang designed and coded
a prototype
@^Plass, Michael Frederick@>
@^Liang, Franklin Mark@>
@^Knuth, Donald Ervin@>
based on some specifications that the author had made in May of that year.
This original proto\TeX\ included macro definitions and elementary
manipulations on boxes and glue, but it did not have line-breaking,
page-breaking, mathematical formulas, alignment routines, error recovery,
or the present semantic nest; furthermore,
it used character lists instead of token lists, so that a control sequence
like \.{\\halign} was represented by a list of seven characters. A
complete version of \TeX\ was designed and coded by the author in late
1977 and early 1978; that program, like its prototype, was written in the
{\mc SAIL} language, for which an excellent debugging system was
available. Preliminary plans to convert the {\mc SAIL} code into a form
somewhat like the present ``web'' were developed by Luis Trabb~Pardo and
@^Trabb Pardo, Luis Isidoro@>
the author at the beginning of 1979, and a complete implementation was
created by Ignacio~A. Zabala in 1979 and 1980. The \TeX82 program, which
@^Zabala Salelles, Ignacio Andr\'es@>
was written by the author during the latter part of 1981 and the early
part of 1982, also incorporates ideas from the 1979 implementation of
@^Guibas, Leonidas Ioannis@>
@^Sedgewick, Robert@>
@^Wyatt, Douglas Kirk@>
\TeX\ in {\mc MESA} that was written by Leonidas Guibas, Robert Sedgewick,
and Douglas Wyatt at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.  Several hundred
refinements were introduced into \TeX82 based on the experiences gained with
the original implementations, so that essentially every part of the system
has been substantially improved. After the appearance of ``Version 0'' in
September 1982, this program benefited greatly from the comments of
many other people, notably David~R. Fuchs and Howard~W. Trickey.
A final revision in September 1989 extended the input character set to
eight-bit codes and introduced the ability to hyphenate words from
different languages, based on some ideas of Michael~J. Ferguson.
@^Fuchs, David Raymond@>
@^Trickey, Howard Wellington@>
@^Ferguson, Michael John@>

No doubt there still is plenty of room for improvement, but the author
is firmly committed to keeping \TeX82 ``frozen'' from now on; stability
and reliability are to be its main virtues.

On the other hand, the \.{WEB} description can be extended without changing
the core of \TeX82 itself, and the program has been designed so that such
extensions are not extremely difficult to make.
The |banner| string defined here should be changed whenever \TeX\
undergoes any modifications, so that it will be clear which version of
\TeX\ might be the guilty party when a problem arises.
@^extensions to \TeX@>
@^system dependencies@>

If this program is changed, the resulting system should not be called
`\TeX'; the official name `\TeX' by itself is reserved
for software systems that are fully compatible with each other.
A special test suite called the ``\.{TRIP} test'' is available for
helping to determine whether a particular implementation deserves to be
known as `\TeX' [cf.~Stanford Computer Science report CS1027,
November 1984].

@d banner	"This is TeX, Version 3.14159265 (HINT)" /*printed when \TeX\ starts*/ 

@ Different \PASCAL s have slightly different conventions, and the present
@!@:PASCAL H}{\ph@>
program expresses \TeX\ in terms of the \PASCAL\ that was
available to the author in 1982. Constructions that apply to
this particular compiler, which we shall call \ph, should help the
reader see how to make an appropriate interface for other systems
if necessary. (\ph\ is Charles Hedrick's modification of a compiler
@^Hedrick, Charles Locke@>
for the DECsystem-10 that was originally developed at the University of
Hamburg; cf.\ {\sl SOFTWARE---Practice \AM\ Experience \bf6} (1976),
29--42. The \TeX\ program below is intended to be adaptable, without
extensive changes, to most other versions of \PASCAL, so it does not fully
use the admirable features of \ph. Indeed, a conscious effort has been
made here to avoid using several idiosyncratic features of standard
\PASCAL\ itself, so that most of the code can be translated mechanically
into other high-level languages. For example, the `\&{with}' and `\\{new}'
features are not used, nor are pointer types, set types, or enumerated
scalar types; there are no `\&{var}' parameters, except in the case of files;
there are no tag fields on variant records; there are no assignments
|double=int|; no procedures are declared local to other procedures.)

The portions of this program that involve system-dependent code, where
changes might be necessary because of differences between \PASCAL\ compilers
and/or differences between
operating systems, can be identified by looking at the sections whose
numbers are listed under `system dependencies' in the index. Furthermore,
the index entries for `dirty \PASCAL' list all places where the restrictions
of \PASCAL\ have not been followed perfectly, for one reason or another.
@!@^system dependencies@>
@!@^dirty \PASCAL@>

Incidentally, \PASCAL's standard |round| function can be problematical,
because it disagrees with the IEEE floating-point standard.
Many implementors have
therefore chosen to substitute their own home-grown rounding procedure.

@ The program begins with a normal \PASCAL\ program heading, whose
components will be filled in later, using the conventions of \.{WEB}.
@.WEB@>
For example, the portion of the program called `\X\glob:Global
variables\X' below will be replaced by a sequence of variable declarations
that starts in $\section\glob$ of this documentation. In this way, we are able
to define each individual global variable when we are prepared to
understand what it means; we do not have to define all of the globals at
once.  Cross references in $\section\glob$, where it says ``See also
sections \gglob, \dots,'' also make it possible to look at the set of
all global variables, if desired.  Similar remarks apply to the other
portions of the program heading.

Actually the heading shown here is not quite normal: The || line
does not mention any |output| file, because \ph\ would ask the \TeX\ user
to specify a file name if |output| were specified here.

@ The overall \TeX\ program begins with the heading just shown, after which
comes a bunch of procedure declarations and function declarations.
Finally we will get to the main program, which begins with the
comment `|start_here|'. If you want to skip down to the
main program now, you can look up `|start_here|' in the index.
But the author suggests that the best way to understand this program
is to follow pretty much the order of \TeX's components as they appear in the
\.{WEB} description you are now reading, since the present ordering is
intended to combine the advantages of the ``bottom up'' and ``top down''
approaches to the problem of understanding a somewhat complicated system.

@ Three labels must be declared in the main program, so we give them
symbolic names.

@ Some of the code below is intended to be used only when diagnosing the
strange behavior that sometimes occurs when \TeX\ is being installed or
when system wizards are fooling around with \TeX\ without quite knowing
what they are doing. Such code will not normally be compiled; it is
delimited by the codewords `$|debug|\ldots|debug|$', with apologies
to people who wish to preserve the purity of English.

Similarly, there is some conditional code delimited by
`$|stat|\ldots|tats|$' that is intended for use when statistics are to be
kept about \TeX's memory usage.  The |stat| $\ldots$ |tats| code also
implements diagnostic information for \.{\\tracingparagraphs} and
\.{\\tracingpages}.
@^debugging@>

@ This program has two important variations: (1) There is a long and slow
version called \.{INITEX}, which does the extra calculations needed to
@.INITEX@>
initialize \TeX's internal tables; and (2)~there is a shorter and faster
production version, which cuts the initialization to a bare minimum.
Parts of the program that are needed in (1) but not in (2) are delimited by
the codewords `$|init|\ldots|tini|$'.

@<Set initial values of key variables@>@;
#ifdef @!INIT
@<Initialize table entries (done by \.{INITEX} only)@>@;
#endif

@ If the first character of a \PASCAL\ comment is a dollar sign,
\ph\ treats the comment as a list of ``compiler directives'' that will
affect the translation of this program into machine language.  The
directives shown below specify full checking and inclusion of the \PASCAL\
debugger when \TeX\ is being debugged, but they cause range checking and other
redundant code to be eliminated when the production system is being generated.
Arithmetic overflow will be detected in all cases.

@ This \TeX\ implementation conforms to the rules of the {\sl Pascal User
@:PASCAL}{\PASCAL@>
@^system dependencies@>
Manual} published by Jensen and Wirth in 1975, except where system-dependent
@^Wirth, Niklaus@>
@^Jensen, Kathleen@>
code is necessary to make a useful system program, and except in another
respect where such conformity would unnecessarily obscure the meaning
and clutter up the code: We assume that |case| statements may include a
default case that applies if no matching label is found. Thus, we shall use
constructions like
$$\vbox{\halign{\ignorespaces#\hfil\cr
|case x|\cr
1: $\langle\,$code for $x=1\,\rangle$;\cr
3: $\langle\,$code for $x=3\,\rangle$;\cr
|default:| $\langle\,$code for |x!=1| and |x!=3|$\,\rangle$\cr
|} |\cr}}$$
since most \PASCAL\ compilers have plugged this hole in the language by
incorporating some sort of default mechanism. For example, the \ph\
compiler allows `|default:|:' as a default label, and other \PASCAL s allow
syntaxes like `\&{else}' or `\&{otherwise}' or `\\{otherwise}:', etc. The
definitions of |default:| and |} | should be changed to agree with
local conventions.  Note that no semicolon appears before |} | in
this program, so the definition of |} | should include a semicolon
if the compiler wants one. (Of course, if no default mechanism is
available, the |case| statements of \TeX\ will have to be laboriously
extended by listing all remaining cases. People who are stuck with such
\PASCAL s have, in fact, done this, successfully but not happily!)

@ The following parameters can be changed at compile time to extend or

@ Like the preceding parameters, the following quantities can be changed
at compile time to extend or reduce \TeX's capacity. But if they are changed,
it is necessary to rerun the initialization program \.{INITEX}
@.INITEX@>
to generate new tables for the production \TeX\ program.
One can't simply make helter-skelter changes to the following constants,
since certain rather complex initialization
numbers are computed from them. They are defined here using
\.{WEB} macros, instead of being put into \PASCAL's || list, in order to
emphasize this distinction.

@d mem_bot	0 /*smallest index in the |mem| array dumped by \.{INITEX};
  must not be less than |mem_min|*/ 
@d mem_top	30000 /*largest index in the |mem| array dumped by \.{INITEX};
  must be substantially larger than |mem_bot|
  and not greater than |mem_max|*/ 
@d font_base	0 /*smallest internal font number; must not be less
  than |min_quarterword|*/ 
@d hash_size	2100 /*maximum number of control sequences; it should be at most
  about |(mem_max-mem_min)/(double)10|*/ 
@d hash_prime	1777 /*a prime number equal to about 85\pct! of |hash_size|*/ 
@d hyph_size	307 /*another prime; the number of \.{\\hyphenation} exceptions*/ 
@^system dependencies@>

@ In case somebody has inadvertently made bad settings of the ``constants,''
\TeX\ checks them using a global variable called |bad|.

This is the first of many sections of \TeX\ where global variables are
defined.

@<Glob...@>=
int @!bad; /*is some ``constant'' wrong?*/ 

@ Later on we will say `\ignorespaces|if (mem_max >= max_halfword) bad=14|',
or something similar. (We can't do that until |max_halfword| has been defined.)

@<Check the ``constant'' values for consistency@>=
bad=0;
if ((half_error_line < 30)||(half_error_line > error_line-15)) bad=1;
if (max_print_line < 60) bad=2;
if (dvi_buf_size%8!=0) bad=3;
if (mem_bot+1100 > mem_top) bad=4;
if (hash_prime > hash_size) bad=5;
if (max_in_open >= 128) bad=6;
if (mem_top < 256+11) bad=7; /*we will want |null_list > 255|*/ 

@ Labels are given symbolic names by the following definitions, so that
occasional |goto| statements will be meaningful. We insert the label
`|end|' just before the `\ignorespaces|} |\unskip' of a procedure in
which we have used the `|goto end|' statement defined below; the label
`|restart|' is occasionally used at the very beginning of a procedure; and
the label `|reswitch|' is occasionally used just prior to a |case|
statement in which some cases change the conditions and we wish to branch
to the newly applicable case.  Loops that are set up with the |loop|
construction defined below are commonly exited by going to `|done|' or to
`|found|' or to `|not_found|', and they are sometimes repeated by going to
`|resume|'.  If two or more parts of a subroutine start differently but
end up the same, the shared code may be gathered together at
`|common_ending|'.

Incidentally, this program never declares a label that isn't actually used,
because some fussy \PASCAL\ compilers will complain about redundant labels.

@d done6	36 /*for exiting the sixth loop in a block*/ 
@ Here are some macros for common programming idioms.

@d incr(X)	X=X+1 /*increase a variable by unity*/ 
@d decr(X)	X=X-1 /*decrease a variable by unity*/ 
@d negate(X)	X=-X /*change the sign of a variable*/ 
@d loop	@+while (true) @+ /*repeat over and over until a |goto| happens*/ 
@f loop else
   /*\.{WEB}'s |else| acts like `\ignorespaces|while true do|\unskip'*/ 
@d do_nothing	 /*empty statement*/ 
@d empty	0 /*symbolic name for a null constant*/ 

@* The character set.
In order to make \TeX\ readily portable to a wide variety of
computers, all of its input text is converted to an internal eight-bit
code that includes standard ASCII, the ``American Standard Code for
Information Interchange.''  This conversion is done immediately when each
character is read in. Conversely, characters are converted from ASCII to
the user's external representation just before they are output to a
text file.

Such an internal code is relevant to users of \TeX\ primarily because it
governs the positions of characters in the fonts. For example, the
character `\.A' has ASCII code $65=0101$, and when \TeX\ typesets
this letter it specifies character number 65 in the current font.
If that font actually has `\.A' in a different position, \TeX\ doesn't
know what the real position is; the program that does the actual printing from
\TeX's device-independent files is responsible for converting from ASCII to

\TeX's internal code also defines the value of constants
that begin with a reverse apostrophe; and it provides an index to the
\.{\\catcode}, \.{\\mathcode}, \.{\\uccode}, \.{\\lccode}, and \.{\\delcode}
tables.

@ Characters of text that have been converted to \TeX's internal form
are said to be of type |ASCII_code|, which is a subrange of the integers.

@<Types...@>=
typedef uint8_t ASCII_code; /*eight-bit numbers*/ 

@ The original \PASCAL\ compiler was designed in the late 60s, when six-bit
character sets were common, so it did not make provision for lowercase
letters. Nowadays, of course, we need to deal with both capital and small
letters in a convenient way, especially in a program for typesetting;
so the present specification of \TeX\ has been written under the assumption
that the \PASCAL\ compiler and run-time system permit the use of text files
with more than 64 distinguishable characters. More precisely, we assume that
the character set contains at least the letters and symbols associated
with ASCII codes 040 through 0176; all of these characters are now
available on most computer terminals.

Since we are dealing with more characters than were present in the first
\PASCAL\ compilers, we have to decide what to call the associated data
type. Some \PASCAL s use the original name |unsigned char| for the
characters in text files, even though there now are more than 64 such
characters, while other \PASCAL s consider |unsigned char| to be a 64-element
subrange of a larger data type that has some other name.

In order to accommodate this difference, we shall use the name |text_char|
to stand for the data type of the characters that are converted to and
from |ASCII_code| when they are input and output. We shall also assume
that |text_char| consists of the elements |chr(first_text_char)| through
|chr(last_text_char)|, inclusive. The following definitions should be
adjusted if necessary.
@^system dependencies@>

@d text_char	unsigned char /*the data type of characters in text files*/

@ Since we are assuming that our \PASCAL\ system is able to read and
write the visible characters of standard ASCII (although not
necessarily using the ASCII codes to represent them), the following
assignment statements initialize the standard part of the |xchr| array
properly, without needing any system-dependent changes. On the other
hand, it is possible to implement \TeX\ with less complete character
sets, and in such cases it will be necessary to change something here.

@ Some of the ASCII codes without visible characters have been given symbolic
names in this program because they are used with a special meaning.

@d null_code	00 /*ASCII code that might disappear*/ 
@d carriage_return	015 /*ASCII code used at end of line*/ 
@d invalid_code	0177 /*ASCII code that many systems prohibit in text files*/ 

@ The ASCII code is ``standard'' only to a certain extent, since many
computer installations have found it advantageous to have ready access
to more than 94 printing characters. Appendix~C of {\sl The \TeX book\/}
gives a complete specification of the intended correspondence between
characters and \TeX's internal representation.
@:TeXbook}{\sl The \TeX book@>

If \TeX\ is being used
on a garden-variety \PASCAL\ for which only standard ASCII
codes will appear in the input and output files, it doesn't really matter
what codes are specified in |xchr[0 dotdot 037]|, but the safest policy is to
blank everything out by using the code shown below.

However, other settings of |xchr| will make \TeX\ more friendly on
computers that have an extended character set, so that users can type things
like `\.^^Z' instead of `\.{\\ne}'. People with extended character sets can
assign codes arbitrarily, giving an |xchr| equivalent to whatever
characters the users of \TeX\ are allowed to have in their input files.
It is best to make the codes correspond to the intended interpretations as
shown in Appendix~C whenever possible; but this is not necessary. For
example, in countries with an alphabet of more than 26 letters, it is
usually best to map the additional letters into codes less than~040.
To get the most ``permissive'' character set, change | ' ' | on the
right of these assignment statements to |chr(i)|.
@^character set dependencies@>

@<Set init...@>=
for (i=0; i<=037; i++) xchr[i]= ' ' ;
for (i=0177; i<=0377; i++) xchr[i]= ' ' ;

@ The following system-independent code makes the |xord| array contain a
suitable inverse to the information in |xchr|. Note that if |xchr[i]==xchr[j]|
where |i < j < 0177|, the value of |xord[xchr[i]]| will turn out to be
|j| or more; hence, standard ASCII code numbers will be used instead of
codes below 040 in case there is a coincidence.

@* Input and output.
The bane of portability is the fact that different operating systems treat
input and output quite differently, perhaps because computer scientists
have not given sufficient attention to this problem. People have felt somehow
that input and output are not part of ``real'' programming. Well, it is true
that some kinds of programming are more fun than others. With existing
input/output conventions being so diverse and so messy, the only sources of
joy in such parts of the code are the rare occasions when one can find a
way to make the program a little less bad than it might have been. We have
two choices, either to attack I/O now and get it over with, or to postpone
I/O until near the end. Neither prospect is very attractive, so let's
get it over with.

The basic operations we need to do are (1)~inputting and outputting of
text, to or from a file or the user's terminal; (2)~inputting and
outputting of eight-bit bytes, to or from a file; (3)~instructing the
operating system to initiate (``open'') or to terminate (``close'') input or
output from a specified file; (4)~testing whether the end of an input
file has been reached.

\TeX\ needs to deal with two kinds of files.
We shall use the term |alpha_file| for a file that contains textual data,
and the term |byte_file| for a file that contains eight-bit binary information.
These two types turn out to be the same on many computers, but
sometimes there is a significant distinction, so we shall be careful to
distinguish between them. Standard protocols for transferring
such files from computer to computer, via high-speed networks, are
now becoming available to more and more communities of users.

The program actually makes use also of a third kind of file, called a
|word_file|, when dumping and reloading base information for its own
initialization.  We shall define a word file later; but it will be possible
for us to specify simple operations on word files before they are defined.

@<Types...@>=
typedef uint8_t eight_bits; /*unsigned one-byte quantity*/ 
typedef struct {@+FILE *f;@+text_char@,d;@+} alpha_file; /*files that contain textual data*/ 
typedef struct {@+FILE *f;@+eight_bits@,d;@+} byte_file; /*files that contain binary data*/ 

@ Most of what we need to do with respect to input and output can be handled
by the I/O facilities that are standard in \PASCAL, i.e., the routines
called |get|, |put|, |eof|, and so on. But
standard \PASCAL\ does not allow file variables to be associated with file
names that are determined at run time, so it cannot be used to implement
\TeX; some sort of extension to \PASCAL's ordinary |reset| and |rewrite|
is crucial for our purposes. We shall assume that |name_of_file| is a variable
of an appropriate type such that the \PASCAL\ run-time system being used to
implement \TeX\ can open a file whose external name is specified by
|name_of_file|.
@^system dependencies@>

@<Glob...@>=
uint8_t @!name_of_file0[file_name_size+1]={0}, *const @!name_of_file = @!name_of_file0-1;@;@/
   /*on some systems this may be a \&{record} variable*/ 
uint8_t @!name_length;@/ /*this many characters are actually
  relevant in |name_of_file| (the rest are blank)*/ 

@ The \ph\ compiler with which the present version of \TeX\ was prepared has
extended the rules of \PASCAL\ in a very convenient way. To open file~|f|,
we can write
$$\vbox{\halign{#\hfil\qquad&#\hfil\cr
|reset(f,@t\\{name}@>,"/O")|&for input;\cr
|rewrite(f,@t\\{name}@>,"/O")|&for output.\cr}}$$
The `\\{name}' parameter, which is of type `{\bf packed array
$[\langle\\{any}\rangle]$ of \\{char}}', stands for the name of
the external file that is being opened for input or output.
Blank spaces that might appear in \\{name} are ignored.

The `\.{/O}' parameter tells the operating system not to issue its own
error messages if something goes wrong. If a file of the specified name
cannot be found, or if such a file cannot be opened for some other reason
(e.g., someone may already be trying to write the same file), we will have
|@!erstat(f)!=0| after an unsuccessful |reset| or |rewrite|.  This allows
\TeX\ to undertake appropriate corrective action.
@:PASCAL H}{\ph@>
@^system dependencies@>

\TeX's file-opening procedures return |false| if no file identified by
|name_of_file| could be opened.

@d reset_OK(X)	erstat(X)==0
@d rewrite_OK(X)	erstat(X)==0

@p bool a_open_in(alpha_file *f)
   /*open a text file for input*/ 
{@+reset((*f), name_of_file,"r");return reset_OK((*f));
} 
@#
bool a_open_out(alpha_file *f)
   /*open a text file for output*/ 
{@+rewrite((*f), name_of_file,"w");return rewrite_OK((*f));
} 
@#
bool b_open_in(byte_file *f)
   /*open a binary file for input*/ 
{@+reset((*f), name_of_file,"rb");return reset_OK((*f));
} 
@#
bool b_open_out(byte_file *f)
   /*open a binary file for output*/ 
{@+rewrite((*f), name_of_file,"wb");return rewrite_OK((*f));
} 
@#
bool w_open_in(word_file *f)
   /*open a word file for input*/ 
{@+reset((*f), name_of_file,"rb");return reset_OK((*f));
} 
@#
bool w_open_out(word_file *f)
   /*open a word file for output*/ 
{@+rewrite((*f), name_of_file,"wb");return rewrite_OK((*f));
} 

@ Files can be closed with the \ph\ routine `|close(f)|', which
@:PASCAL H}{\ph@>
@^system dependencies@>
should be used when all input or output with respect to |f| has been completed.
This makes |f| available to be opened again, if desired; and if |f| was used for
output, the |close| operation makes the corresponding external file appear
on the user's area, ready to be read.

These procedures should not generate error messages if a file is
being closed before it has been successfully opened.

@p void a_close(alpha_file *f) /*close a text file*/ 
{@+close((*f));
} 
@#
void b_close(byte_file *f) /*close a binary file*/ 
{@+close((*f));
} 
@#
void w_close(word_file *f) /*close a word file*/ 
{@+close((*f));
} 

@ Binary input and output are done with \PASCAL's ordinary |get| and |put|
procedures, so we don't have to make any other special arrangements for
binary~I/O. Text output is also easy to do with standard \PASCAL\ routines.
The treatment of text input is more difficult, however, because
of the necessary translation to |ASCII_code| values.
\TeX's conventions should be efficient, and they should
blend nicely with the user's operating environment.

@ Input from text files is read one line at a time, using a routine called
|input_ln|. This function is defined in terms of global variables called
|buffer|, |first|, and |last| that will be described in detail later; for
now, it suffices for us to know that |buffer| is an array of |ASCII_code|
values, and that |first| and |last| are indices into this array
representing the beginning and ending of a line of text.

@<Glob...@>=
ASCII_code @!buffer[buf_size+1]; /*lines of characters being read*/ 
uint16_t @!first; /*the first unused position in |buffer|*/ 
uint16_t @!last; /*end of the line just input to |buffer|*/ 
uint16_t @!max_buf_stack; /*largest index used in |buffer|*/ 

@ The |input_ln| function brings the next line of input from the specified
file into available positions of the buffer array and returns the value
|true|, unless the file has already been entirely read, in which case it
returns |false| and sets |last=first|.  In general, the |ASCII_code|
numbers that represent the next line of the file are input into
|buffer[first]|, |buffer[first+1]|, \dots, |buffer[last-1]|; and the
global variable |last| is set equal to |first| plus the length of the
line. Trailing blanks are removed from the line; thus, either |last==first|
(in which case the line was entirely blank) or |buffer[last-1]!=' '|.

An overflow error is given, however, if the normal actions of |input_ln|
would make |last >= buf_size|; this is done so that other parts of \TeX\
can safely look at the contents of |buffer[last+1]| without overstepping
the bounds of the |buffer| array. Upon entry to |input_ln|, the condition
|first < buf_size| will always hold, so that there is always room for an
``empty'' line.

The variable |max_buf_stack|, which is used to keep track of how large
the |buf_size| parameter must be to accommodate the present job, is
also kept up to date by |input_ln|.

If the |bypass_eoln| parameter is |true|, |input_ln| will do a |get|
before looking at the first character of the line; this skips over
an |eoln| that was in |f.d|. The procedure does not do a |get| when it
reaches the end of the line; therefore it can be used to acquire input
from the user's terminal as well as from ordinary text files.

Standard \PASCAL\ says that a file should have |eoln| immediately
before |eof|, but \TeX\ needs only a weaker restriction: If |eof|
occurs in the middle of a line, the system function |eoln| should return
a |true| result (even though |f.d| will be undefined).

Since the inner loop of |input_ln| is part of \TeX's ``inner loop''---each
character of input comes in at this place---it is wise to reduce system
overhead by making use of special routines that read in an entire array
of characters at once, if such routines are available. The following
code uses standard \PASCAL\ to illustrate what needs to be done, but
finer tuning is often possible at well-developed \PASCAL\ sites.
@^inner loop@>

@p bool input_ln(alpha_file *f, bool @!bypass_eoln)
   /*inputs the next line or returns |false|*/ 
{@+uint16_t last_nonblank; /*|last| with trailing blanks removed*/ 
if (bypass_eoln) if (!eof((*f))) get((*f));
   /*input the first character of the line into |f.d|*/ 
last=first; /*cf.\ Matthew 19\thinspace:\thinspace30*/ 
if (eof((*f))) return false;
else{@+last_nonblank=first;
  while (!eoln((*f))) 
    {@+if (last >= max_buf_stack) 
      {@+max_buf_stack=last+1;
      if (max_buf_stack==buf_size) 
        @<Report overflow of the input buffer, and abort@>;
      } 
    buffer[last]=xord[(*f).d];get((*f));incr(last);
    if (buffer[last-1]!=' ') last_nonblank=last;
    } 
  last=last_nonblank;return true;
  } 
} 

@ The user's terminal acts essentially like other files of text, except
that it is used both for input and for output. When the terminal is
considered an input file, the file variable is called |term_in|, and when it
is considered an output file the file variable is |term_out|.
@^system dependencies@>

@<Glob...@>=
alpha_file @!term_in; /*the terminal as an input file*/ 
alpha_file @!term_out; /*the terminal as an output file*/ 

@ Here is how to open the terminal files
in \ph. The `\.{/I}' switch suppresses the first |get|.
@:PASCAL H}{\ph@>
@^system dependencies@>

@d t_open_in	term_in.f=stdin /*open the terminal for text input*/ 
@d t_open_out   term_out.f=stdout /*open the terminal for text output*/ 

@ Sometimes it is necessary to synchronize the input/output mixture that
happens on the user's terminal, and three system-dependent
procedures are used for this
purpose. The first of these, |update_terminal|, is called when we want
to make sure that everything we have output to the terminal so far has
actually left the computer's internal buffers and been sent.
The second, |clear_terminal|, is called when we wish to cancel any
input that the user may have typed ahead (since we are about to
issue an unexpected error message). The third, |wake_up_terminal|,
is supposed to revive the terminal if the user has disabled it by
some instruction to the operating system.  The following macros show how
these operations can be specified in \ph:
@:PASCAL H}{\ph@>
@^system dependencies@>

@d update_terminal	fflush(term_out.f) /*empty the terminal output buffer*/ 
@d clear_terminal	fflush(term_in.f) /*clear the terminal input buffer*/ 
@d wake_up_terminal	do_nothing /*cancel the user's cancellation of output*/ 

@ We need a special routine to read the first line of \TeX\ input from
the user's terminal. This line is different because it is read before we
have opened the transcript file; there is sort of a ``chicken and
egg'' problem here. If the user types `\.{\\input paper}' on the first
line, or if some macro invoked by that line does such an \.{\\input},
the transcript file will be named `\.{paper.log}'; but if no \.{\\input}
commands are performed during the first line of terminal input, the transcript
file will acquire its default name `\.{texput.log}'. (The transcript file
will not contain error messages generated by the first line before the
first \.{\\input} command.)
@.texput@>

The first line is even more special if we are lucky enough to have an operating
system that treats \TeX\ differently from a run-of-the-mill \PASCAL\ object
program. It's nice to let the user start running a \TeX\ job by typing
a command line like `\.{tex paper}'; in such a case, \TeX\ will operate
as if the first line of input were `\.{paper}', i.e., the first line will
consist of the remainder of the command line, after the part that invoked
\TeX.

The first line is special also because it may be read before \TeX\ has
input a format file. In such cases, normal error messages cannot yet
be given. The following code uses concepts that will be explained later.
(If the \PASCAL\ compiler does not support non-local |@!goto|\unskip, the
@^system dependencies@>
statement `|goto exit(0)|' should be replaced by something that
quietly terminates the program.)

@<Report overflow of the input buffer, and abort@>=

  } 
else{@+cur_input.loc_field=first;cur_input.limit_field=last-1;
  overflow("buffer size", buf_size);
@:TeX capacity exceeded buffer size}{\quad buffer size@>
  } 

@ Different systems have different ways to get started. But regardless of
what conventions are adopted, the routine that initializes the terminal
should satisfy the following specifications:

\yskip\textindent{1)}It should open file |term_in| for input from the
  terminal. (The file |term_out| will already be open for output to the
  terminal.)

\textindent{2)}If the user has given a command line, this line should be
  considered the first line of terminal input. Otherwise the
  user should be prompted with `\.{**}', and the first line of input
  should be whatever is typed in response.

\textindent{3)}The first line of input, which might or might not be a
  command line, should appear in locations |first| to |last-1| of the
  |buffer| array.

\textindent{4)}The global variable |loc| should be set so that the
  character to be read next by \TeX\ is in |buffer[loc]|. This
  character should not be blank, and we should have |loc < last|.

\yskip\noindent(It may be necessary to prompt the user several times
before a non-blank line comes in. The prompt is `\.{**}' instead of the
later `\.*' because the meaning is slightly different: `\.{\\input}' need
not be typed immediately after~`\.{**}'.)

@d loc	cur_input.loc_field /*location of first unread character in |buffer|*/

  } 
} 

@* String handling.
Control sequence names and diagnostic messages are variable-length strings
of eight-bit characters. Since \PASCAL\ does not have a well-developed string
mechanism, \TeX\ does all of its string processing by homegrown methods.

Elaborate facilities for dynamic strings are not needed, so all of the
necessary operations can be handled with a simple data structure.
The array |str_pool| contains all of the (eight-bit) ASCII codes in all
of the strings, and the array |str_start| contains indices of the starting
points of each string. Strings are referred to by integer numbers, so that
string number |s| comprises the characters |str_pool[j]| for
|str_start[s] <= j < str_start[s+1]|. Additional integer variables
|pool_ptr| and |str_ptr| indicate the number of entries used so far
in |str_pool| and |str_start|, respectively; locations
|str_pool[pool_ptr]| and |str_start[str_ptr]| are
ready for the next string to be allocated.

String numbers 0 to 255 are reserved for strings that correspond to single
ASCII characters. This is in accordance with the conventions of \.{WEB},
@.WEB@>
which converts single-character strings into the ASCII code number of the
single character involved, while it converts other strings into integers
and builds a string pool file. Thus, when the string constant \.{"."} appears
in the program below, \.{WEB} converts it into the integer 46, which is the
ASCII code for a period, while \.{WEB} will convert a string like \.{"hello"}
into some integer greater than~255. String number 46 will presumably be the
single character `\..'; but some ASCII codes have no standard visible
representation, and \TeX\ sometimes needs to be able to print an arbitrary
ASCII character, so the first 256 strings are used to specify exactly what
should be printed for each of the 256 possibilities.

Elements of the |str_pool| array must be ASCII codes that can actually
be printed; i.e., they must have an |xchr| equivalent in the local
character set. (This restriction applies only to preloaded strings,
not to those generated dynamically by the user.)

Some \PASCAL\ compilers won't pack integers into a single byte unless the
integers lie in the range |-128 dotdot 127|. To accommodate such systems
we access the string pool only via macros that can easily be redefined.

@ Several of the elementary string operations are performed using \.{WEB}
macros instead of \PASCAL\ procedures, because many of the

overhead of procedure calls. For example, here is
a simple macro that computes the length of a string.

value of |pool_ptr| has gotten too high; this test is supposed to be
made before |append_char| is used. There is also a |flush_char|
macro, which erases the last character appended.

To test if there is room to append |l| more characters to |str_pool|,
we shall write |str_room(l)|, which aborts \TeX\ and gives an
apologetic error message if there isn't enough room.

officially becomes a string when the function |make_string| is called.

@ The first 128 strings will contain 95 standard ASCII characters, and the
other 33 characters will be printed in three-symbol form like `\.{\^\^A}'
unless a system-dependent change is made here. Installations that have
an extended character set, where for example |xchr[032]==@t\.{\'^^Z\'}@>|,
would like string 032 to be the single character 032 instead of the
three characters 0136, 0136, 0132 (\.{\^\^Z}). On the other hand,
even people with an extended character set will want to represent string
015 by \.{\^\^M}, since 015 is |carriage_return|; the idea is to
produce visible strings instead of tabs or line-feeds or carriage-returns
or bell-rings or characters that are treated anomalously in text files.

Unprintable characters of codes 128--255 are, similarly, rendered
\.{\^\^80}--\.{\^\^ff}.

The boolean expression defined here should be |true| unless \TeX\
internal code number~|k| corresponds to a non-troublesome visible
symbol in the local character set.  An appropriate formula for the
extended character set recommended in {\sl The \TeX book\/} would, for
example, be `|k in[0, 010 dotdot 012, 014, 015, 033, 0177 dotdot 0377]|'.
If character |k| cannot be printed, and |k < 0200|, then character |k+0100| or
|k-0100| must be printable; moreover, ASCII codes |[041 dotdot 046,
060 dotdot 071, 0136, 0141 dotdot 0146, 0160 dotdot 0171]| must be printable.

@* On-line and off-line printing.
Messages that are sent to a user's terminal and to the transcript-log file
are produced by several `|print|' procedures. These procedures will
direct their output to a variety of places, based on the setting of
the global variable |selector|, which has the following possible
values:

\yskip
\hang |term_and_log|, the normal setting, prints on the terminal and on the
  transcript file.

\hang |log_only|, prints only on the transcript file.

\hang |term_only|, prints only on the terminal.

\hang |no_print|, doesn't print at all. This is used only in rare cases
  before the transcript file is open.

\hang |pseudo|, puts output into a cyclic buffer that is used
  by the |show_context| routine; when we get to that routine we shall discuss
  the reasoning behind this curious mode.

\hang |new_string|, appends the output to the current string in the
  string pool.

\hang 0 to 15, prints on one of the sixteen files for \.{\\write} output.

\yskip
\noindent The symbolic names `|term_and_log|', etc., have been assigned
numeric codes that satisfy the convenient relations |no_print+1==term_only|,
|no_print+2==log_only|, |term_only+2==log_only+1==term_and_log|.

Three additional global variables, |tally| and |term_offset| and
|file_offset|, record the number of characters that have been printed
since they were most recently cleared to zero. We use |tally| to record
the length of (possibly very long) stretches of printing; |term_offset|
and |file_offset|, on the other hand, keep track of how many characters
have appeared so far on the current line that has been output to the
terminal or to the transcript file, respectively.

@* Reporting errors.
When something anomalous is detected, \TeX\ typically does something like this:
$$\vbox{\halign{#\hfil\cr
|print_err("Something anomalous has been detected");|\cr
|help3("This is the first line of my offer to help.")|\cr
|("This is the second line. I'm trying to")|\cr
|("explain the best way for you to proceed.");|\cr
|error;|\cr}}$$
A two-line help message would be given using |help2|, etc.; these informal
helps should use simple vocabulary that complements the words used in the
official error message that was printed. (Outside the U.S.A., the help
messages should preferably be translated into the local vernacular. Each
line of help is at most 60 characters long, in the present implementation,
so that |max_print_line| will not be exceeded.)

The |print_err| procedure supplies a `\.!' before the official message,
and makes sure that the terminal is awake if a stop is going to occur.
The |error| procedure supplies a `\..' after the official message, then it
shows the location of the error; and if |interaction==error_stop_mode|,
it also enters into a dialog with the user, during which time the help
message may be printed.
@^system dependencies@>

@ The global variable |interaction| has four settings, representing increasing
amounts of user interaction:

@d batch_mode	0 /*omits all stops and omits terminal output*/ 
@d nonstop_mode	1 /*omits all stops*/ 
@d scroll_mode	2 /*omits error stops*/ 
@d error_stop_mode	3 /*stops at every opportunity to interact*/ 
@d print_err(X)	{@+if (interaction==error_stop_mode) wake_up_terminal;
  print_nl("! ");print_str(X);
  } 

@<Glob...@>=
uint8_t @!interaction; /*current level of interaction*/ 

@ @<Set init...@>=interaction=error_stop_mode;

@ \TeX\ is careful not to call |error| when the print |selector| setting
might be unusual. The only possible values of |selector| at the time of
error messages are

\yskip\hang|no_print| (when |interaction==batch_mode|
  and |log_file| not yet open);

\hang|term_only| (when |interaction > batch_mode| and |log_file| not yet open);

\hang|log_only| (when |interaction==batch_mode| and |log_file| is open);

\hang|term_and_log| (when |interaction > batch_mode| and |log_file| is open).

@<Initialize the print |selector| based on |interaction|@>=
if (interaction==batch_mode) selector=no_print;@+else selector=term_only

@ A global variable |deletions_allowed| is set |false| if the |get_next|
routine is active when |error| is called; this ensures that |get_next|
and related routines like |get_token| will never be called recursively.
A similar interlock is provided by |set_box_allowed|.
@^recursion@>

The global variable |history| records the worst level of error that
has been detected. It has four possible values: |spotless|, |warning_issued|,
|error_message_issued|, and |fatal_error_stop|.

Another global variable, |error_count|, is increased by one when an
|error| occurs without an interactive dialog, and it is reset to zero at
the end of every paragraph.  If |error_count| reaches 100, \TeX\ decides
that there is no point in continuing further.

@d spotless	0 /*|history| value when nothing has been amiss yet*/ 
@d warning_issued	1 /*|history| value when |begin_diagnostic| has been called*/ 
@d error_message_issued	2 /*|history| value when |error| has been called*/ 
@d fatal_error_stop	3 /*|history| value when termination was premature*/

bool @!set_box_allowed; /*is it safe to do a \.{\\setbox} assignment?*/ 
uint8_t @!history; /*has the source input been clean so far?*/ 
int8_t @!error_count; /*the number of scrolled errors since the
  last paragraph ended*/ 

@ The value of |history| is initially |fatal_error_stop|, but it will
be changed to |spotless| if \TeX\ survives the initialization process.

@<Set init...@>=
deletions_allowed=true;set_box_allowed=true;
error_count=0; /*|history| is initialized elsewhere*/ 

@ Since errors can be detected almost anywhere in \TeX, we want to declare the
error procedures near the beginning of the program. But the error procedures
in turn use some other procedures, which need to be declared |forward|
before we get to |error| itself.

It is possible for |error| to be called recursively if some error arises
when |get_token| is being used to delete a token, and/or if some fatal error
occurs while \TeX\ is trying to fix a non-fatal one. But such recursion

@* Arithmetic with scaled dimensions.
The principal computations performed by \TeX\ are done entirely in terms of
integers less than $2^{31}$ in magnitude; and divisions are done only when both
dividend and divisor are nonnegative. Thus, the arithmetic specified in this
program can be carried out in exactly the same way on a wide variety of
computers, including some small ones. Why? Because the arithmetic
calculations need to be spelled out precisely in order to guarantee that
\TeX\ will produce identical output on different machines. If some
quantities were rounded differently in different implementations, we would
find that line breaks and even page breaks might occur in different places.
Hence the arithmetic of \TeX\ has been designed with care, and systems that
claim to be implementations of \TeX82 should follow precisely the
@:TeX82}{\TeX82@>
calculations as they appear in the present program.

(Actually there are three places where \TeX\ uses |/| with a possibly negative
numerator. These are harmless; see |/| in the index. Also if the user
sets the \.{\\time} or the \.{\\year} to a negative value, some diagnostic
information will involve negative-numerator division. The same remarks
apply for |%| as well as for |/|.)

@ Here is a routine that calculates half of an integer, using an

@ The following function is used to create a scaled integer from a given decimal

@ Conversely, here is a procedure analogous to |print_int|. If the output
of this procedure is subsequently read by \TeX\ and converted by the
|round_decimals| routine above, it turns out that the original value will
be reproduced exactly; the ``simplest'' such decimal number is output,
but there is always at least one digit following the decimal point.

The invariant relation in the \&{repeat} loop is that a sequence of
decimal digits yet to be printed will yield the original number if and only if
they form a fraction~$f$ in the range $s-\delta\L10\cdot2^{16}f<s$.
We can stop if and only if $f=0$ satisfies this condition; the loop will
terminate before $s$ can possibly become zero.

@ Physical sizes that a \TeX\ user specifies for portions of documents are
represented internally as scaled points. Thus, if we define an `sp' (scaled
@^sp@>
point) as a unit equal to $2^{-16}$ printer's points, every dimension
inside of \TeX\ is an integer number of sp. There are exactly
4,736,286.72 sp per inch.  Users are not allowed to specify dimensions
larger than $2^{30}-1$ sp, which is a distance of about 18.892 feet (5.7583
meters); two such quantities can be added without overflow on a 32-bit
computer.

The present implementation of \TeX\ does not check for overflow when
@^overflow in arithmetic@>
dimensions are added or subtracted. This could be done by inserting a
few dozen tests of the form `\ignorespaces|if (x >= 010000000000)@/
@t\\{report\_overflow}@>|', but the chance of overflow is so remote that
such tests do not seem worthwhile.

\TeX\ needs to do only a few arithmetic operations on scaled quantities,
other than addition and subtraction, and the following subroutines do most of
the work. A single computation might use several subroutine calls, and it is
desirable to avoid producing multiple error messages in case of arithmetic
overflow; so the routines set the global variable |arith_error| to |true|
instead of reporting errors directly to the user. Another global variable,
|rem|, holds the remainder after a division.

@<Glob...@>=
bool @!arith_error; /*has arithmetic overflow occurred recently?*/

  return n*x+y;

this subroutine simulates 1.5-precision arithmetic.

@ The next subroutine is used to compute the ``badness'' of glue, when a
total~|t| is supposed to be made from amounts that sum to~|s|.  According
to {\sl The \TeX book}, the badness of this situation is $100(t/s)^3$;
however, badness is simply a heuristic, so we need not squeeze out the
last drop of accuracy when computing it. All we really want is an
approximation that has similar properties.
@:TeXbook}{\sl The \TeX book@>

The actual method used to compute the badness is easier to read from the
program than to describe in words. It produces an integer value that is a
reasonably close approximation to $100(t/s)^3$, and all implementations
of \TeX\ should use precisely this method. Any badness of $2^{13}$ or more is
treated as infinitely bad, and represented by 10000.

It is not difficult to prove that $$\hbox{|badness(t+1, s) >= badness(t, s)
 >= badness(t, s+1)|}.$$ The badness function defined here is capable of
computing at most 1095 distinct values, but that is plenty.

@ When \TeX\ ``packages'' a list into a box, it needs to calculate the
proportionality ratio by which the glue inside the box should stretch
or shrink. This calculation does not affect \TeX's decision making,
so the precise details of rounding, etc., in the glue calculation are not
of critical importance for the consistency of results on different computers.

We shall use the type |glue_ratio| for such proportionality ratios.
A glue ratio should take the same amount of memory as an
|int| (usually 32 bits) if it is to blend smoothly with \TeX's
other data structures. Thus |glue_ratio| should be equivalent to
|short_real| in some implementations of \PASCAL. Alternatively,
it is possible to deal with glue ratios using nothing but fixed-point
arithmetic; see {\sl TUGboat \bf3},1 (March 1982), 10--27. (But the
routines cited there must be modified to allow negative glue ratios.)

typedef float32_t @!glue_ratio; /*one-word representation of a glue expansion factor*/ 

@* Packed data.
In order to make efficient use of storage space, \TeX\ bases its major data
structures on a |memory_word|, which contains either a (signed) integer,
possibly scaled, or a (signed) |glue_ratio|, or a small number of
fields that are one half or one quarter of the size used for storing
integers.

If |x| is a variable of type |memory_word|, it contains up to four
fields that can be referred to as follows:
$$\vbox{\halign{\hfil#&#\hfil&#\hfil\cr
|x|&.|i|&(an |int|)\cr
|x|&.|sc|\qquad&(a |scaled| integer)\cr
|x|&.|gr|&(a |glue_ratio|)\cr
|x.hh.lh|, |x.hh|&.|rh|&(two halfword fields)\cr
|x.hh.b0|, |x.hh.b1|, |x.hh|&.|rh|&(two quarterword fields, one halfword
  field)\cr
|x.qqqq.b0|, |x.qqqq.b1|, |x.qqqq|&.|b2|, |x.qqqq.b3|\hskip-100pt
  &\qquad\qquad\qquad(four quarterword fields)\cr}}$$
This is somewhat cumbersome to write, and not very readable either, but
macros will be used to make the notation shorter and more transparent.
The \PASCAL\ code below gives a formal definition of |memory_word| and
its subsidiary types, using packed variant records. \TeX\ makes no
assumptions about the relative positions of the fields within a word.

Since we are assuming 32-bit integers, a halfword must contain at least
16 bits, and a quarterword must contain at least 8 bits.
@^system dependencies@>
But it doesn't hurt to have more bits; for example, with enough 36-bit
words you might be able to have |mem_max| as large as 262142, which is
eight times as much memory as anybody had during the first four years of
\TeX's existence.

N.B.: Valuable memory space will be dreadfully wasted unless \TeX\ is compiled
by a \PASCAL\ that packs all of the |memory_word| variants into
the space of a single integer. This means, for example, that |glue_ratio|
words should be |short_real| instead of |double| on some computers. Some
\PASCAL\ compilers will pack an integer whose subrange is `|0 dotdot 255|' into
an eight-bit field, but others insist on allocating space for an additional
sign bit; on such systems you can get 256 values into a quarterword only
if the subrange is `|-128 dotdot 127|'.

The present implementation tries to accommodate as many variations as possible,
so it makes few assumptions. If integers having the subrange
`|min_quarterword dotdot max_quarterword|' can be packed into a quarterword,
and if integers having the subrange `|min_halfword dotdot max_halfword|'
can be packed into a halfword, everything should work satisfactorily.

It is usually most efficient to have |min_quarterword==min_halfword==0|,
so one should try to achieve this unless it causes a severe problem.
The values defined here are recommended for most 32-bit computers.

@d min_quarterword	0 /*smallest allowable value in a |quarterword|*/ 
@d max_quarterword	255 /*largest allowable value in a |quarterword|*/ 
@d min_halfword	0 /*smallest allowable value in a |halfword|*/ 
@d max_halfword	65535 /*largest allowable value in a |halfword|*/ 

@ Here are the inequalities that the quarterword and halfword values
must satisfy (or rather, the inequalities that they mustn't satisfy):

@<Check the ``constant''...@>=
#ifdef @!INIT
if ((mem_min!=mem_bot)||(mem_max!=mem_top)) bad=10;
#endif

@ The operation of adding or subtracting |min_quarterword| occurs quite
frequently in \TeX, so it is convenient to abbreviate this operation
by using the macros |qi| and |qo| for input and output to and from
quarterword format.

The inner loop of \TeX\ will run faster with respect to compilers
that don't optimize expressions like `|x+0|' and `|x-0|', if these
macros are simplified in the obvious way when |min_quarterword==0|.

@* Dynamic memory allocation.
The \TeX\ system does nearly all of its own memory allocation, so that it
can readily be transported into environments that do not have automatic
facilities for strings, garbage collection, etc., and so that it can be in
control of what error messages the user receives. The dynamic storage
requirements of \TeX\ are handled by providing a large array |mem| in
which consecutive blocks of words are used as nodes by the \TeX\ routines.

Pointer variables are indices into this array, or into another array
called |eqtb| that will be explained later. A pointer variable might
also be a special flag that lies outside the bounds of |mem|, so we
allow pointers to assume any |halfword| value. The minimum halfword
value represents a null pointer. \TeX\ does not assume that |mem[null]| exists.

@d pointer	halfword /*a flag or a location in |mem| or |eqtb|*/ 
@s pointer int
@d null	min_halfword /*the null pointer*/ 

@<Glob...@>=
pointer @!temp_ptr; /*a pointer variable for occasional emergency use*/ 

@ The |mem| array is divided into two regions that are allocated separately,
but the dividing line between these two regions is not fixed; they grow
together until finding their ``natural'' size in a particular job.
Locations less than or equal to |lo_mem_max| are used for storing
variable-length records consisting of two or more words each. This region
is maintained using an algorithm similar to the one described in exercise
2.5--19 of {\sl The Art of Computer Programming}. However, no size field
appears in the allocated nodes; the program is responsible for knowing the
relevant size when a node is freed. Locations greater than or equal to
|hi_mem_min| are used for storing one-word records; a conventional
\.{AVAIL} stack is used for allocation in this region.

Locations of |mem| between |mem_bot| and |mem_top| may be dumped as part
of preloaded format files, by the \.{INITEX} preprocessor.
@.INITEX@>
Production versions of \TeX\ may extend the memory at both ends in order to
provide more space; locations between |mem_min| and |mem_bot| are always
used for variable-size nodes, and locations between |mem_top| and |mem_max|
are always used for single-word nodes.

The key pointers that govern |mem| allocation have a prescribed order:
$$\advance\thickmuskip-2mu
\hbox{|null <= mem_min <= mem_bot < lo_mem_max < 
  hi_mem_min < mem_top <= mem_end <= mem_max|.}$$

Empirical tests show that the present implementation of \TeX\ tends to
spend about 9\pct! of its running time allocating nodes, and about 6\pct!
deallocating them after their use.

@* Data structures for boxes and their friends.
From the computer's standpoint, \TeX's chief mission is to create
horizontal and vertical lists. We shall now investigate how the elements
of these lists are represented internally as nodes in the dynamic memory.

A horizontal or vertical list is linked together by |link| fields in
the first word of each node. Individual nodes represent boxes, glue,
penalties, or special things like discretionary hyphens; because of this
variety, some nodes are longer than others, and we must distinguish different
kinds of nodes. We do this by putting a `|type|' field in the first word,
together with the link and an optional `|subtype|'.

@d type(X)	mem[X].hh.b0 /*identifies what kind of node this is*/ 
@d subtype(X)	mem[X].hh.b1 /*secondary identification in some cases*/ 

@ A |@!char_node|, which represents a single character, is the most important
kind of node because it accounts for the vast majority of all boxes.
Special precautions are therefore taken to ensure that a |char_node| does
not take up much memory space. Every such node is one word long, and in fact
it is identifiable by this property, since other kinds of nodes have at least
two words, and they appear in |mem| locations less than |hi_mem_min|.
This makes it possible to omit the |type| field in a |char_node|, leaving
us room for two bytes that identify a |font| and a |character| within
that font.

Note that the format of a |char_node| allows for up to 256 different
fonts and up to 256 characters per font; but most implementations will
probably limit the total number of fonts to fewer than 75 per job,
and most fonts will stick to characters whose codes are
less than 128 (since higher codes
are more difficult to access on most keyboards).

Extensions of \TeX\ intended for oriental languages will need even more
than $256\times256$ possible characters, when we consider different sizes
@^oriental characters@>@^Chinese characters@>@^Japanese characters@>
and styles of type.  It is suggested that Chinese and Japanese fonts be
handled by representing such characters in two consecutive |char_node|
entries: The first of these has |font==font_base|, and its |link| points
to the second;
the second identifies the font and the character dimensions.
The saving feature about oriental characters is that most of them have
the same box dimensions. The |character| field of the first |char_node|
is a ``\\{charext}'' that distinguishes between graphic symbols whose
dimensions are identical for typesetting purposes. (See the \MF\ manual.)
Such an extension of \TeX\ would not be difficult; further details are
left to the reader.

In order to make sure that the |character| code fits in a quarterword,
\TeX\ adds the quantity |min_quarterword| to the actual code.

Character nodes appear only in horizontal lists, never in vertical lists.

@d is_char_node(X)	(X >= hi_mem_min)
   /*does the argument point to a |char_node|?*/ 
@d font	type /*the font code in a |char_node|*/ 
@d character	subtype /*the character code in a |char_node|*/ 

@ An |hlist_node| stands for a box that was made from a horizontal list.
Each |hlist_node| is seven words long, and contains the following fields
(in addition to the mandatory |type| and |link|, which we shall not
mention explicitly when discussing the other node types): The |height| and
|width| and |depth| are scaled integers denoting the dimensions of the
box.  There is also a |shift_amount| field, a scaled integer indicating
how much this box should be lowered (if it appears in a horizontal list),
or how much it should be moved to the right (if it appears in a vertical
list). There is a |list_ptr| field, which points to the beginning of the
list from which this box was fabricated; if |list_ptr| is |null|, the box
is empty. Finally, there are three fields that represent the setting of
the glue:  |glue_set(p)| is a word of type |glue_ratio| that represents
the proportionality constant for glue setting; |glue_sign(p)| is
|stretching| or |shrinking| or |normal| depending on whether or not the
glue should stretch or shrink or remain rigid; and |glue_order(p)|
specifies the order of infinity to which glue setting applies (|normal|,
|fil|, |fill|, or |filll|). The |subtype| field is not used.

@d hlist_node	0 /*|type| of hlist nodes*/ 
@d box_node_size	7 /*number of words to allocate for a box node*/ 
@d width_offset	1 /*position of |width| field in a box node*/ 
@d depth_offset	2 /*position of |depth| field in a box node*/

@d width(X)	mem[X+width_offset].sc /*width of the box, in sp*/ 
@d depth(X)	mem[X+depth_offset].sc /*depth of the box, in sp*/ 
@d height(X)	mem[X+height_offset].sc /*height of the box, in sp*/ 
@d shift_amount(X)	mem[X+4].sc /*repositioning distance, in sp*/ 
@d list_offset	5 /*position of |list_ptr| field in a box node*/ 
@d list_ptr(X)	link(X+list_offset) /*beginning of the list inside the box*/ 
@d glue_order(X)	subtype(X+list_offset) /*applicable order of infinity*/ 
@d glue_sign(X)	type(X+list_offset) /*stretching or shrinking*/ 
@d normal	0 /*the most common case when several cases are named*/

@d glue_offset	6 /*position of |glue_set| in a box node*/ 
@d glue_set(X)	mem[X+glue_offset].gr
   /*a word of type |glue_ratio| for glue setting*/ 

@ The |new_null_box| function returns a pointer to an |hlist_node| in
which all subfields have the values corresponding to `\.{\\hbox\{\}}'.
The |subtype| field is set to |min_quarterword|, since that's the desired
|span_count| value if this |hlist_node| is changed to an |unset_node|.

@p pointer new_null_box(void) /*creates a new box node*/ 
{@+pointer p; /*the new node*/ 
p=get_node(box_node_size);type(p)=hlist_node;

glue_sign(p)=normal;glue_order(p)=normal;set_glue_ratio_zero(glue_set(p));
return p;
} 

@ A |vlist_node| is like an |hlist_node| in all respects except that it
contains a vertical list.

@d vlist_node	1 /*|type| of vlist nodes*/ 

@ A |rule_node| stands for a solid black rectangle; it has |width|,
|depth|, and |height| fields just as in an |hlist_node|. However, if
any of these dimensions is $-2^{30}$, the actual value will be determined
by running the rule up to the boundary of the innermost enclosing box.
This is called a ``running dimension.'' The |width| is never running in
an hlist; the |height| and |depth| are never running in a~vlist.

@d rule_node	2 /*|type| of rule nodes*/ 
@d rule_node_size	4 /*number of words to allocate for a rule node*/ 
@d null_flag	-010000000000 /*$-2^{30}$, signifies a missing item*/ 
@d is_running(X)	(X==null_flag) /*tests for a running dimension*/ 

@ A new rule node is delivered by the |new_rule| function. It
makes all the dimensions ``running,'' so you have to change the
ones that are not allowed to run.

@p pointer new_rule(void)
{@+pointer p; /*the new node*/ 
p=get_node(rule_node_size);type(p)=rule_node;
subtype(p)=0; /*the |subtype| is not used*/ 
width(p)=null_flag;depth(p)=null_flag;height(p)=null_flag;
return p;
} 

@ Insertions are represented by |ins_node| records, where the |subtype|
indicates the corresponding box number. For example, `\.{\\insert 250}'
leads to an |ins_node| whose |subtype| is |250+min_quarterword|.
The |height| field of an |ins_node| is slightly misnamed; it actually holds
the natural height plus depth of the vertical list being inserted.
The |depth| field holds the |split_max_depth| to be used in case this
insertion is split, and the |split_top_ptr| points to the corresponding
|split_top_skip|. The |float_cost| field holds the |floating_penalty| that
will be used if this insertion floats to a subsequent page after a
split insertion of the same class.  There is one more field, the
|ins_ptr|, which points to the beginning of the vlist for the insertion.

@d ins_node	3 /*|type| of insertion nodes*/ 
@d ins_node_size	5 /*number of words to allocate for an insertion*/ 
@d float_cost(X)	mem[X+1].i /*the |floating_penalty| to be used*/ 
@d ins_ptr(X)	info(X+4) /*the vertical list to be inserted*/ 
@d split_top_ptr(X)	link(X+4) /*the |split_top_skip| to be used*/ 

@ A |mark_node| has a |mark_ptr| field that points to the reference count
of a token list that contains the user's \.{\\mark} text.
This field occupies a full word instead of a halfword, because
there's nothing to put in the other halfword; it is easier in \PASCAL\ to
use the full word than to risk leaving garbage in the unused half.

@d mark_node	4 /*|type| of a mark node*/ 
@d small_node_size	2 /*number of words to allocate for most node types*/ 
@d mark_ptr(X)	mem[X+1].i /*head of the token list for a mark*/ 

@ An |adjust_node|, which occurs only in horizontal lists,
specifies material that will be moved out into the surrounding
vertical list; i.e., it is used to implement \TeX's `\.{\\vadjust}'
operation.  The |adjust_ptr| field points to the vlist containing this
material.

@d adjust_node	5 /*|type| of an adjust node*/ 
@d adjust_ptr	mark_ptr /*vertical list to be moved out of horizontal list*/ 

@ A |ligature_node|, which occurs only in horizontal lists, specifies
a character that was fabricated from the interaction of two or more
actual characters.  The second word of the node, which is called the
|lig_char| word, contains |font| and |character| fields just as in a
|char_node|. The characters that generated the ligature have not been
forgotten, since they are needed for diagnostic messages and for
hyphenation; the |lig_ptr| field points to a linked list of character
nodes for all original characters that have been deleted. (This list
might be empty if the characters that generated the ligature were
retained in other nodes.)

The |subtype| field is 0, plus 2 and/or 1 if the original source of the
ligature included implicit left and/or right boundaries.

@d ligature_node	6 /*|type| of a ligature node*/ 
@d lig_char(X)	X+1 /*the word where the ligature is to be found*/ 
@d lig_ptr(X)	link(lig_char(X)) /*the list of characters*/ 

@ The |new_ligature| function creates a ligature node having given
contents of the |font|, |character|, and |lig_ptr| fields. We also have
a |new_lig_item| function, which returns a two-word node having a given
|character| field. Such nodes are used for temporary processing as ligatures
are being created.

@p pointer new_ligature(quarterword @!f, quarterword @!c, pointer @!q)
{@+pointer p; /*the new node*/ 
p=get_node(small_node_size);type(p)=ligature_node;
font(lig_char(p))=f;character(lig_char(p))=c;lig_ptr(p)=q;
subtype(p)=0;return p;
} 
@#
pointer new_lig_item(quarterword @!c)
{@+pointer p; /*the new node*/ 
p=get_node(small_node_size);character(p)=c;lig_ptr(p)=null;
return p;
} 

@ A |disc_node|, which occurs only in horizontal lists, specifies a
``dis\-cretion\-ary'' line break. If such a break occurs at node |p|, the text
that starts at |pre_break(p)| will precede the break, the text that starts at
|post_break(p)| will follow the break, and text that appears in the next
|replace_count(p)| nodes will be ignored. For example, an ordinary
discretionary hyphen, indicated by `\.{\\-}', yields a |disc_node| with
|pre_break| pointing to a |char_node| containing a hyphen, |post_break==null|,
and |replace_count==0|. All three of the discretionary texts must be
lists that consist entirely of character, kern, box, rule, and ligature nodes.

If |pre_break(p)==null|, the |ex_hyphen_penalty| will be charged for this
break.  Otherwise the |hyphen_penalty| will be charged.  The texts will
actually be substituted into the list by the line-breaking algorithm if it
decides to make the break, and the discretionary node will disappear at
that time; thus, the output routine sees only discretionaries that were
not chosen.

@d disc_node	7 /*|type| of a discretionary node*/ 
@d replace_count	subtype /*how many subsequent nodes to replace*/ 
@d pre_break	llink /*text that precedes a discretionary break*/ 
@d post_break	rlink /*text that follows a discretionary break*/ 

@p pointer new_disc(void) /*creates an empty |disc_node|*/ 
{@+pointer p; /*the new node*/ 
p=get_node(small_node_size);type(p)=disc_node;
replace_count(p)=0;pre_break(p)=null;post_break(p)=null;
return p;
} 

@ A |whatsit_node| is a wild card reserved for extensions to \TeX. The
|subtype| field in its first word says what `\\{whatsit}' it is, and
implicitly determines the node size (which must be 2 or more) and the
format of the remaining words. When a |whatsit_node| is encountered
in a list, special actions are invoked; knowledgeable people who are
careful not to mess up the rest of \TeX\ are able to make \TeX\ do new
things by adding code at the end of the program. For example, there
might be a `\TeX nicolor' extension to specify different colors of ink,
@^extensions to \TeX@>
and the whatsit node might contain the desired parameters.

The present implementation of \TeX\ treats the features associated with
`\.{\\write}' and `\.{\\special}' as if they were extensions, in order to
illustrate how such routines might be coded. We shall defer further
discussion of extensions until the end of this program.

@d whatsit_node	8 /*|type| of special extension nodes*/ 

@ A |math_node|, which occurs only in horizontal lists, appears before and
after mathematical formulas. The |subtype| field is |before| before the
formula and |after| after it. There is a |width| field, which represents
the amount of surrounding space inserted by \.{\\mathsurround}.

@d math_node	9 /*|type| of a math node*/ 
@d before	0 /*|subtype| for math node that introduces a formula*/ 
@d after	1 /*|subtype| for math node that winds up a formula*/ 

@p pointer new_math(scaled @!w, small_number @!s)
{@+pointer p; /*the new node*/ 
p=get_node(small_node_size);type(p)=math_node;
subtype(p)=s;width(p)=w;return p;
} 

@ \TeX\ makes use of the fact that |hlist_node|, |vlist_node|,
|rule_node|, |ins_node|, |mark_node|, |adjust_node|, |ligature_node|,
|disc_node|, |whatsit_node|, and |math_node| are at the low end of the
type codes, by permitting a break at glue in a list if and only if the
|type| of the previous node is less than |math_node|. Furthermore, a
node is discarded after a break if its type is |math_node| or~more.

@d precedes_break(X)	(type(X) < math_node)
@d non_discardable(X)	(type(X) < math_node)

@ A |glue_node| represents glue in a list. However, it is really only
a pointer to a separate glue specification, since \TeX\ makes use of the
fact that many essentially identical nodes of glue are usually present.
If |p| points to a |glue_node|, |glue_ptr(p)| points to
another packet of words that specify the stretch and shrink components, etc.

Glue nodes also serve to represent leaders; the |subtype| is used to
distinguish between ordinary glue (which is called |normal|) and the three
kinds of leaders (which are called |a_leaders|, |c_leaders|, and |x_leaders|).
The |leader_ptr| field points to a rule node or to a box node containing the
leaders; it is set to |null| in ordinary glue nodes.

Many kinds of glue are computed from \TeX's ``skip'' parameters, and
it is helpful to know which parameter has led to a particular glue node.
Therefore the |subtype| is set to indicate the source of glue, whenever
it originated as a parameter. We will be defining symbolic names for the
parameter numbers later (e.g., |line_skip_code==0|, |baseline_skip_code==1|,
etc.); it suffices for now to say that the |subtype| of parametric glue
will be the same as the parameter number, plus~one.

In math formulas there are two more possibilities for the |subtype| in a
glue node: |mu_glue| denotes an \.{\\mskip} (where the units are scaled \.{mu}
instead of scaled \.{pt}); and |cond_math_glue| denotes the `\.{\\nonscript}'
feature that cancels the glue node immediately following if it appears
in a subscript.

@d glue_node	10 /*|type| of node that points to a glue specification*/ 
@d cond_math_glue	98 /*special |subtype| to suppress glue in the next node*/ 
@d mu_glue	99 /*|subtype| for math glue*/ 
@d a_leaders	100 /*|subtype| for aligned leaders*/ 
@d c_leaders	101 /*|subtype| for centered leaders*/ 
@d x_leaders	102 /*|subtype| for expanded leaders*/ 
@d glue_ptr	llink /*pointer to a glue specification*/ 
@d leader_ptr	rlink /*pointer to box or rule node for leaders*/ 

@ A glue specification has a halfword reference count in its first word,
@^reference counts@>
representing |null| plus the number of glue nodes that point to it (less one).
Note that the reference count appears in the same position as
the |link| field in list nodes; this is the field that is initialized
to |null| when a node is allocated, and it is also the field that is flagged
by |empty_flag| in empty nodes.

Glue specifications also contain three |scaled| fields, for the |width|,
|stretch|, and |shrink| dimensions. Finally, there are two one-byte
fields called |stretch_order| and |shrink_order|; these contain the
orders of infinity (|normal|, |fil|, |fill|, or |filll|)
corresponding to the stretch and shrink values.

@d glue_spec_size	4 /*number of words to allocate for a glue specification*/ 
@d glue_ref_count(X)	link(X) /*reference count of a glue specification*/

@d shrink_order	subtype /*order of infinity for shrinking*/

@<Types...@>=
typedef uint8_t glue_ord; /*infinity to the 0, 1, 2, or 3 power*/ 

@ Here is a function that returns a pointer to a copy of a glue spec.
The reference count in the copy is |null|, because there is assumed
to be exactly one reference to the new specification.

@p pointer new_spec(pointer @!p) /*duplicates a glue specification*/

mem[q]=mem[p];glue_ref_count(q)=null;@/
width(q)=width(p);stretch(q)=stretch(p);shrink(q)=shrink(p);
return q;
} 

@ And here's a function that creates a glue node for a given parameter
identified by its code number; for example,
|new_param_glue(line_skip_code)| returns a pointer to a glue node for the
current \.{\\lineskip}.

@p pointer new_param_glue(small_number @!n)

q=@<Current |mem| equivalent of glue parameter number |n|@>@t@>;

} 

@ Glue nodes that are more or less anonymous are created by |new_glue|,
whose argument points to a glue specification.

return p;
} 

@ Still another subroutine is needed: This one is sort of a combination
of |new_param_glue| and |new_glue|. It creates a glue node for one of
the current glue parameters, but it makes a fresh copy of the glue
specification, since that specification will probably be subject to change,
while the parameter will stay put. The global variable |temp_ptr| is
set to the address of the new spec.

@p pointer new_skip_param(small_number @!n)
{@+pointer p; /*the new node*/ 
temp_ptr=new_spec(@<Current |mem| equivalent of glue parameter...@>);
p=new_glue(temp_ptr);glue_ref_count(temp_ptr)=null;subtype(p)=n+1;
return p;
} 

@ A |kern_node| has a |width| field to specify a (normally negative)
amount of spacing. This spacing correction appears in horizontal lists
between letters like A and V when the font designer said that it looks
better to move them closer together or further apart. A kern node can
also appear in a vertical list, when its `|width|' denotes additional
spacing in the vertical direction. The |subtype| is either |normal| (for
kerns inserted from font information or math mode calculations) or |explicit|
(for kerns inserted from \.{\\kern} and \.{\\/} commands) or |acc_kern|
(for kerns inserted from non-math accents) or |mu_glue| (for kerns
inserted from \.{\\mkern} specifications in math formulas).

@d kern_node	11 /*|type| of a kern node*/

@ A |penalty_node| specifies the penalty associated with line or page
breaking, in its |penalty| field. This field is a fullword integer, but
the full range of integer values is not used: Any penalty | >= 10000| is
treated as infinity, and no break will be allowed for such high values.
Similarly, any penalty | <= -10000| is treated as negative infinity, and a
break will be forced.

penalty(p)=m;return p;
} 

@ You might think that we have introduced enough node types by now. Well,
almost, but there is one more: An |unset_node| has nearly the same format
as an |hlist_node| or |vlist_node|; it is used for entries in \.{\\halign}
or \.{\\valign} that are not yet in their final form, since the box
dimensions are their ``natural'' sizes before any glue adjustment has been
made. The |glue_set| word is not present; instead, we have a |glue_stretch|
field, which contains the total stretch of order |glue_order| that is
present in the hlist or vlist being boxed.
Similarly, the |shift_amount| field is replaced by a |glue_shrink| field,
containing the total shrink of order |glue_sign| that is present.
The |subtype| field is called |span_count|; an unset box typically
contains the data for |qo(span_count)+1| columns.
Unset nodes will be changed to box nodes when alignment is completed.

@d unset_node	13 /*|type| for an unset node*/ 
@d glue_stretch(X)	mem[X+glue_offset].sc /*total stretch in an unset node*/ 
@d glue_shrink	shift_amount /*total shrink in an unset node*/ 
@d span_count	subtype /*indicates the number of spanned columns*/ 

@ In fact, there are still more types coming. When we get to math formula
processing we will see that a |style_node| has |type==14|; and a number
of larger type codes will also be defined, for use in math mode only.

@ Warning: If any changes are made to these data structure layouts, such as
changing any of the node sizes or even reordering the words of nodes,
the |copy_node_list| procedure and the memory initialization code
below may have to be changed. Such potentially dangerous parts of the
program are listed in the index under `data structure assumptions'.
@!@^data structure assumptions@>
However, other references to the nodes are made symbolically in terms of
the \.{WEB} macro definitions above, so that format changes will leave
\TeX's other algorithms intact.
@^system dependencies@>

@* Memory layout.
Some areas of |mem| are dedicated to fixed usage, since static allocation is
more efficient than dynamic allocation when we can get away with it. For
example, locations |mem_bot| to |mem_bot+3| are always used to store the
specification for glue that is `\.{0pt plus 0pt minus 0pt}'. The
following macro definitions accomplish the static allocation by giving
symbolic names to the fixed positions. Static variable-size nodes appear
in locations |mem_bot| through |lo_mem_stat_max|, and static single-word nodes
appear in locations |hi_mem_stat_min| through |mem_top|, inclusive. It is
harmless to let |lig_trick| and |garbage| share the same location of |mem|.

@ If \TeX\ is extended improperly, the |mem| array might get screwed up.
For example, some pointers might be wrong, or some ``dead'' nodes might not
have been freed when the last reference to them disappeared. Procedures
|check_mem| and |search_mem| are available to help diagnose such
problems. These procedures make use of two arrays called |is_free| and
|was_free| that are present only if \TeX's debugging routines have
been included. (You may want to decrease the size of |mem| while you

@* Displaying boxes.
We can reinforce our knowledge of the data structures just introduced
by considering two procedures that display a list in symbolic form.
The first of these, called |short_display|, is used in ``overfull box''
messages to give the top-level description of a list. The other one,
called |show_node_list|, prints a detailed description of exactly what
is in the data structure.

The philosophy of |short_display| is to ignore the fine points about exactly
what is inside boxes, except that ligatures and discretionary breaks are
expanded. As a result, |short_display| is a recursive procedure, but the
recursion is never more than one level deep.
@^recursion@>

A global variable |font_in_short_display| keeps track of the font code that
is assumed to be present when |short_display| begins; deviations from this
font will be printed.

@<Glob...@>=

@ The |show_node_list| routine requires some auxiliary subroutines: one to
print a font-and-character combination, one to print a token list without
its reference count, and one to print a rule dimension.

    {@+print_char('l');decr(order);
    } 
  } 
else if (s!=0) print(s);
} 

@ The next subroutine prints a whole glue specification.

   /*prints a glue specification*/ 
{@+if ((p < mem_min)||(p >= lo_mem_max)) print_char('*');

    } 
  if (shrink(p)!=0) 
    {@+print_str(" minus ");print_glue(shrink(p), shrink_order(p), s);
    } 
  } 
} 

@ We also need to declare some procedures that appear later in this
documentation.

@p@<Declare procedures needed for displaying the elements of mlists@>@;
@<Declare the procedure called |print_skip_param|@>@;

@ Since boxes can be inside of boxes, |show_node_list| is inherently recursive,
@^recursion@>
up to a given maximum number of levels.  The history of nesting is indicated
by the current string, which will be printed at the beginning of each line;
the length of this string, namely |cur_length|, is the depth of nesting.

Recursive calls on |show_node_list| therefore use the following pattern:

@d node_list_display(X)	
  {@+append_char('.');show_node_list(X);flush_char;
  }  /*|str_room| need not be checked; see |show_box| below*/ 

@ A global variable called |depth_threshold| is used to record the maximum
depth of nesting for which |show_node_list| will show information.  If we
have |depth_threshold==0|, for example, only the top level information will
be given and no sublists will be traversed. Another global variable, called
|breadth_max|, tells the maximum number of items to show at each level;
|breadth_max| had better be positive, or you won't see anything.

@<Glob...@>=
int @!depth_threshold; /*maximum nesting depth in box displays*/ 
int @!breadth_max; /*maximum number of items shown at the same list level*/ 

@ Now we are ready for |show_node_list| itself. This procedure has been
written to be ``extra robust'' in the sense that it should not crash or get
into a loop even if the data structures have been messed up by bugs in
the rest of the program. You can safely call its parent routine
|show_box(p)| for arbitrary values of |p| when you are debugging \TeX.
However, in the presence of bad data, the procedure may
@^dirty \PASCAL@>@^debugging@>
fetch a |memory_word| whose variant is different from the way it was stored;
for example, it might try to read |mem[p].hh| when |mem[p]|

@* Destroying boxes.
When we are done with a node list, we are obliged to return it to free
storage, including all of its sublists. The recursive procedure
|flush_node_list| does this for us.

@ First, however, we shall consider two non-recursive procedures that do
simpler tasks. The first of these, |delete_token_ref|, is called when
a pointer to a token list's reference count is being removed. This means
that the token list should disappear if the reference count was |null|,
otherwise the count should be decreased by one.

{@+if (token_ref_count(p)==null) flush_list(p);

@ Similarly, |delete_glue_ref| is called when a pointer to a glue
specification is being withdrawn.

@* Copying boxes.
Another recursive operation that acts on boxes is sometimes needed: The
procedure |copy_node_list| returns a pointer to another node list that has
the same structure and meaning as the original. Note that since glue
specifications and token lists have reference counts, we need not make
copies of them. Reference counts can never get too large to fit in a
halfword, since each pointer to a node is in a different memory address,
and the total number of memory addresses fits in a halfword.
@^recursion@>
@^reference counts@>

(Well, there actually are also references from outside |mem|; if the
|save_stack| is made arbitrarily large, it would theoretically be possible
to break \TeX\ by overflowing a reference count. But who would want to do that?)

@d add_token_ref(X)	incr(token_ref_count(X)) /*new reference to a token list*/ 
@d add_glue_ref(X)	incr(glue_ref_count(X)) /*new reference to a glue spec*/ 

@ The copying procedure copies words en masse without bothering
to look at their individual fields. If the node format changes---for
example, if the size is altered, or if some link field is moved to another
relative position---then this code may need to be changed too.

@* The command codes.
Before we can go any further, we need to define symbolic names for the internal
code numbers that represent the various commands obeyed by \TeX. These codes
are somewhat arbitrary, but not completely so. For example, the command
codes for character types are fixed by the language, since a user says,
e.g., `\.{\\catcode \`\\\${} = 3}' to make \.{\char'44} a math delimiter,
and the command code |math_shift| is equal to~3. Some other codes have
been made adjacent so that |case| statements in the program need not consider
cases that are widely spaced, or so that |case| statements can be replaced
by |if (| statements.

At any rate, here is the list, for future reference. First come the
``catcode'' commands, several of which share their numeric codes with
ordinary commands when the catcode cannot emerge from \TeX's scanning routine.

@* The semantic nest.
\TeX\ is typically in the midst of building many lists at once. For example,
when a math formula is being processed, \TeX\ is in math mode and
working on an mlist; this formula has temporarily interrupted \TeX\ from
being in horizontal mode and building the hlist of a paragraph; and this
paragraph has temporarily interrupted \TeX\ from being in vertical mode
and building the vlist for the next page of a document. Similarly, when a
\.{\\vbox} occurs inside of an \.{\\hbox}, \TeX\ is temporarily
interrupted from working in restricted horizontal mode, and it enters
internal vertical mode.  The ``semantic nest'' is a stack that
keeps track of what lists and modes are currently suspended.

At each level of processing we are in one of six modes:

\yskip\hang|vmode| stands for vertical mode (the page builder);

\hang|hmode| stands for horizontal mode (the paragraph builder);

\hang|mmode| stands for displayed formula mode;

\hang|-vmode| stands for internal vertical mode (e.g., in a \.{\\vbox});

\hang|-hmode| stands for restricted horizontal mode (e.g., in an \.{\\hbox});

\hang|-mmode| stands for math formula mode (not displayed).

\yskip\noindent The mode is temporarily set to zero while processing \.{\\write}
texts in the |ship_out| routine.

Numeric values are assigned to |vmode|, |hmode|, and |mmode| so that
\TeX's ``big semantic switch'' can select the appropriate thing to
do by computing the value |abs(mode)+cur_cmd|, where |mode| is the current
mode and |cur_cmd| is the current command code.

@d vmode	1 /*vertical mode*/ 
@d hmode	(vmode+max_command+1) /*horizontal mode*/ 
@d mmode	(hmode+max_command+1) /*math mode*/ 

@p void print_mode(int @!m) /*prints the mode represented by |m|*/ 
{@+if (m > 0) 
  switch (m/(max_command+1)) {
  case 0: print_str("vertical");@+break;
  case 1: print_str("horizontal");@+break;
  case 2: print_str("display math");
  } 
else if (m==0) print_str("no");
else switch ((-m)/(max_command+1)) {
  case 0: print_str("internal vertical");@+break;
  case 1: print_str("restricted horizontal");@+break;
  case 2: print_str("math");
  } 
print_str(" mode");
} 

@ The state of affairs at any semantic level can be represented by
five values:

\yskip\hang|mode| is the number representing the semantic mode, as
just explained.

\yskip\hang|head| is a |pointer| to a list head for the list being built;
|link(head)| therefore points to the first element of the list, or
to |null| if the list is empty.

\yskip\hang|tail| is a |pointer| to the final node of the list being
built; thus, |tail==head| if and only if the list is empty.

\yskip\hang|prev_graf| is the number of lines of the current paragraph that
have already been put into the present vertical list.

\yskip\hang|aux| is an auxiliary |memory_word| that gives further information
that is needed to characterize the situation.

\yskip\noindent
In vertical mode, |aux| is also known as |prev_depth|; it is the scaled
value representing the depth of the previous box, for use in baseline
calculations, or it is | <= -1000|pt if the next box on the vertical list is to
be exempt from baseline calculations.  In horizontal mode, |aux| is also
known as |space_factor| and |clang|; it holds the current space factor used in
spacing calculations, and the current language used for hyphenation.
(The value of |clang| is undefined in restricted horizontal mode.)
In math mode, |aux| is also known as |incompleat_noad|; if
not |null|, it points to a record that represents the numerator of a
generalized fraction for which the denominator is currently being formed
in the current list.

There is also a sixth quantity, |mode_line|, which correlates
the semantic nest with the user's input; |mode_line| contains the source
line number at which the current level of nesting was entered. The negative
of this line number is the |mode_line| at the level of the
user's output routine.

In horizontal mode, the |prev_graf| field is used for initial language data.

The semantic nest is an array called |nest| that holds the |mode|, |head|,
|tail|, |prev_graf|, |aux|, and |mode_line| values for all semantic levels
below the currently active one. Information about the currently active
level is kept in the global quantities |mode|, |head|, |tail|, |prev_graf|,
|aux|, and |mode_line|, which live in a \PASCAL\ record that is ready to
be pushed onto |nest| if necessary.

@ Here is a common way to make the current list grow:

@d tail_append(X)	{@+link(tail)=X;tail=link(tail);
  } 

@ We will see later that the vertical list at the bottom semantic level is split
into two parts; the ``current page'' runs from |page_head| to |page_tail|,
and the ``contribution list'' runs from |contrib_head| to |tail| of
semantic level zero. The idea is that contributions are first formed in
vertical mode, then ``contributed'' to the current page (during which time
the page-breaking decisions are made). For now, we don't need to know
any more details about the page-building process.

@* The table of equivalents.
Now that we have studied the data structures for \TeX's semantic routines,
we ought to consider the data structures used by its syntactic routines. In
other words, our next concern will be
the tables that \TeX\ looks at when it is scanning
what the user has written.

The biggest and most important such table is called |eqtb|. It holds the
current ``equivalents'' of things; i.e., it explains what things mean
or what their current values are, for all quantities that are subject to
the nesting structure provided by \TeX's grouping mechanism. There are six
parts to |eqtb|:

\yskip\hangg 1) |eqtb[active_base dotdot(hash_base-1)]| holds the current
equivalents of single-character control sequences.

\yskip\hangg 2) |eqtb[hash_base dotdot(glue_base-1)]| holds the current
equivalents of multiletter control sequences.

\yskip\hangg 3) |eqtb[glue_base dotdot(local_base-1)]| holds the current
equivalents of glue parameters like the current baselineskip.

\yskip\hangg 4) |eqtb[local_base dotdot(int_base-1)]| holds the current
equivalents of local halfword quantities like the current box registers,
the current ``catcodes,'' the current font, and a pointer to the current
paragraph shape.

\yskip\hangg 5) |eqtb[int_base dotdot(dimen_base-1)]| holds the current
equivalents of fullword integer parameters like the current hyphenation
penalty.

\yskip\hangg 6) |eqtb[dimen_base dotdot eqtb_size]| holds the current equivalents
of fullword dimension parameters like the current hsize or amount of
hanging indentation.

\yskip\noindent Note that, for example, the current amount of
baselineskip glue is determined by the setting of a particular location
in region~3 of |eqtb|, while the current meaning of the control sequence
`\.{\\baselineskip}' (which might have been changed by \.{\\def} or
\.{\\let}) appears in region~2.

@ Each entry in |eqtb| is a |memory_word|. Most of these words are of type
|two_halves|, and subdivided into three fields:

\yskip\hangg 1) The |eq_level| (a quarterword) is the level of grouping at
which this equivalent was defined. If the level is |level_zero|, the
equivalent has never been defined; |level_one| refers to the outer level
(outside of all groups), and this level is also used for global
definitions that never go away. Higher levels are for equivalents that
will disappear at the end of their group.  @^global definitions@>

\yskip\hangg 2) The |eq_type| (another quarterword) specifies what kind of
entry this is. There are many types, since each \TeX\ primitive like
\.{\\hbox}, \.{\\def}, etc., has its own special code. The list of
command codes above includes all possible settings of the |eq_type| field.

\yskip\hangg 3) The |equiv| (a halfword) is the current equivalent value.
This may be a font number, a pointer into |mem|, or a variety of other
things.

@d eq_level_field(X)	X.hh.b1
@d eq_type_field(X)	X.hh.b0
@d equiv_field(X)	X.hh.rh
@d eq_level(X)	eq_level_field(eqtb[X]) /*level of definition*/ 
@d eq_type(X)	eq_type_field(eqtb[X]) /*command code for equivalent*/ 
@d equiv(X)	equiv_field(eqtb[X]) /*equivalent value*/ 
@d level_zero	min_quarterword /*level for undefined quantities*/ 
@d level_one	(level_zero+1) /*outermost level for defined quantities*/ 

@ Many locations in |eqtb| have symbolic names. The purpose of the next
paragraphs is to define these names, and to set up the initial values of the
equivalents.

In the first region we have 256 equivalents for ``active characters'' that
act as control sequences, followed by 256 equivalents for single-character
control sequences.

Then comes region~2, which corresponds to the hash table that we will
define later.  The maximum address in this region is used for a dummy
control sequence that is perpetually undefined. There also are several
locations for control sequences that are perpetually defined
(since they are used in error recovery).

@d active_base	1 /*beginning of region 1, for active character equivalents*/ 
@d single_base	(active_base+256) /*equivalents of one-character control sequences*/ 
@d null_cs	(single_base+256) /*equivalent of \.{\\csname\\endcsname}*/

   /*permanent `\.{\\nullfont}'*/ 
@d font_id_base	(frozen_null_font-font_base)
   /*begins table of 257 permanent font identifiers*/ 
@d undefined_control_sequence	(frozen_null_font+257) /*dummy location*/ 
@d glue_base	(undefined_control_sequence+1) /*beginning of region 3*/ 

@<Initialize table entries...@>=
eq_type(undefined_control_sequence)=undefined_cs;
equiv(undefined_control_sequence)=null;
eq_level(undefined_control_sequence)=level_zero;
for (k=active_base; k<=undefined_control_sequence-1; k++) 
  eqtb[k]=eqtb[undefined_control_sequence];

@ Here is a routine that displays the current meaning of an |eqtb| entry
in region 1 or~2. (Similar routines for the other regions will appear
below.)

  {@+print_char(':');show_token_list(link(equiv(n)), null, 32);
  } 
}

glue parameters defined here. It is important that the ``muskip''
parameters have larger numbers than the others.

@ Region 5 of |eqtb| contains the integer parameters and registers defined
here, as well as the |del_code| table. The latter table differs from the
|cat_code dotdot math_code| tables that precede it, since delimiter codes are
fullword integers while the other kinds of codes occupy at most a
halfword. This is what makes region~5 different from region~4. We will
store the |eq_level| information in an auxiliary array of quarterwords
that will be defined later.

@* The hash table.
Control sequences are stored and retrieved by means of a fairly standard hash
table algorithm called the method of ``coalescing lists'' (cf.\ Algorithm 6.4C
in {\sl The Art of Computer Programming\/}). Once a control sequence enters the
table, it is never removed, because there are complicated situations
involving \.{\\gdef} where the removal of a control sequence at the end of
a group would be a mistake preventable only by the introduction of a
complicated reference-count mechanism.

The actual sequence of letters forming a control sequence identifier is
stored in the |str_pool| array together with all the other strings. An
auxiliary array |hash| consists of items with two halfword fields per
word. The first of these, called |next(p)|, points to the next identifier
belonging to the same coalesced list as the identifier corresponding to~|p|;
and the other, called |text(p)|, points to the |str_start| entry for
|p|'s identifier. If position~|p| of the hash table is empty, we have
|text(p)==0|; if position |p| is either empty or the end of a coalesced
hash list, we have |next(p)==0|. An auxiliary pointer variable called
|hash_used| is maintained in such a way that all locations |p >= hash_used|
are nonempty. The global variable |cs_count| tells how many multiletter
control sequences have been defined, if statistics are being kept.

A global boolean variable called |no_new_control_sequence| is set to
|true| during the time that new hash table entries are forbidden.

@d next(X)	hash[X].lh /*link for coalesced lists*/ 
@d text(X)	hash[X].rh /*string number for control sequence name*/ 
@d hash_is_full	(hash_used==hash_base) /*test if all positions are occupied*/

@ Single-character control sequences do not need to be looked up in a hash
table, since we can use the character code itself as a direct address.
The procedure |print_cs| prints the name of a control sequence, given
a pointer to its address in |eqtb|. A space is printed after the name
unless it is a single nonletter or an active character. This procedure
might be invoked with invalid data, so it is ``extra robust.'' The
individual characters must be printed one at a time using |print|, since
they may be unprintable.

@ We will deal with the other primitives later, at some point in the program
where their |eq_type| and |equiv| values are more meaningful.  For example,
the primitives for math mode will be loaded when we consider the routines
that deal with formulas. It is easy to find where each particular
primitive was treated by looking in the index at the end; for example, the
section where |@[@<|"radical"|@>@]| entered |eqtb| is listed under `\.{\\radical}
primitive'. (Primitives consisting of a single nonalphabetic character,
@!like `\.{\\/}', are listed under `Single-character primitives'.)
@!@^Single-character primitives@>

Meanwhile, this is a convenient place to catch up on something we were unable
to do before the hash table was defined:

@<Print the font identifier for |font(p)|@>=
print_esc(font_id_text(font(p)))

@* Saving and restoring equivalents.
The nested structure provided by `$\.{\char'173}\ldots\.{\char'175}$' groups
in \TeX\ means that |eqtb| entries valid in outer groups should be saved
and restored later if they are overridden inside the braces. When a new |eqtb|
value is being assigned, the program therefore checks to see if the previous
entry belongs to an outer level. In such a case, the old value is placed
on the |save_stack| just before the new value enters |eqtb|. At the
end of a grouping level, i.e., when the right brace is sensed, the
|save_stack| is used to restore the outer values, and the inner ones are
destroyed.

Entries on the |save_stack| are of type |memory_word|. The top item on
this stack is |save_stack[p]|, where |p==save_ptr-1|; it contains three
fields called |save_type|, |save_level|, and |save_index|, and it is
interpreted in one of four ways:

\yskip\hangg 1) If |save_type(p)==restore_old_value|, then
|save_index(p)| is a location in |eqtb| whose current value should
be destroyed at the end of the current group and replaced by |save_stack[p-1]|.
Furthermore if |save_index(p) >= int_base|, then |save_level(p)|
should replace the corresponding entry in |xeq_level|.

\yskip\hangg 2) If |save_type(p)==restore_zero|, then |save_index(p)|
is a location in |eqtb| whose current value should be destroyed at the end
of the current group, when it should be
replaced by the current value of |eqtb[undefined_control_sequence]|.

\yskip\hangg 3) If |save_type(p)==insert_token|, then |save_index(p)|
is a token that should be inserted into \TeX's input when the current
group ends.

\yskip\hangg 4) If |save_type(p)==level_boundary|, then |save_level(p)|
is a code explaining what kind of group we were previously in, and
|save_index(p)| points to the level boundary word at the bottom of
the entries for that group.

@d save_type(X)	save_stack[X].hh.b0 /*classifies a |save_stack| entry*/ 
@d save_level(X)	save_stack[X].hh.b1

@d level_boundary	3 /*|save_type| corresponding to beginning of group*/

kinds of groups. They allow \TeX\ to decide what special actions, if any,
should be performed when a group ends.
\def\grp{\.{\char'173...\char'175}}

Some groups are not supposed to be ended by right braces. For example,
the `\.\$' that begins a math formula causes a |math_shift_group| to
be started, and this should be terminated by a matching `\.\$'. Similarly,
a group that starts with \.{\\left} should end with \.{\\right}, and
one that starts with \.{\\begingroup} should end with \.{\\endgroup}.

@ The global variable |cur_group| keeps track of what sort of group we are
currently in. Another global variable, |cur_boundary|, points to the
topmost |level_boundary| word.  And |cur_level| is the current depth of
nesting. The routines are designed to preserve the condition that no entry
in the |save_stack| or in |eqtb| ever has a level greater than |cur_level|.

@ At this time it might be a good idea for the reader to review the introduction
to |eqtb| that was given above just before the long lists of parameter names.
Recall that the ``outer level'' of the program is |level_one|, since
undefined control sequences are assumed to be ``defined'' at |level_zero|.

@<Set init...@>=

@ The following macro is used to test if there is room for up to six more
entries on |save_stack|. By making a conservative test like this, we can
get by with testing for overflow in only a few places.

@d check_full_save_stack	if (save_ptr > max_save_stack)

  if (max_save_stack > save_size-6) overflow("save size", save_size);

  } 

@ Procedure |new_save_level| is called when a group begins. The
argument is a group identification code like `|hbox_group|'. After
calling this routine, it is safe to put five more entries on |save_stack|.

In some cases integer-valued items are placed onto the
|save_stack| just below a |level_boundary| word, because this is a
convenient place to keep information that is supposed to ``pop up'' just
when the group has finished.
For example, when `\.{\\hbox to 100pt}\grp' is being treated, the 100pt
dimension is stored on |save_stack| just before |new_save_level| is
called.

We use the notation |saved(k)| to stand for an integer item that
appears in location |save_ptr+k| of the save stack.

@* Token lists.
A \TeX\ token is either a character or a control sequence, and it is
@^token@>
represented internally in one of two ways: (1)~A character whose ASCII
code number is |c| and whose command code is |m| is represented as the
number $2^8m+c$; the command code is in the range |1 <= m <= 14|. (2)~A control
sequence whose |eqtb| address is |p| is represented as the number
|cs_token_flag+p|. Here |cs_token_flag==@t$2^{12}-1$@>| is larger than
$2^8m+c$, yet it is small enough that |cs_token_flag+p < max_halfword|;
thus, a token fits comfortably in a halfword.

A token |t| represents a |left_brace| command if and only if
|t < left_brace_limit|; it represents a |right_brace| command if and only if
we have |left_brace_limit <= t < right_brace_limit|; and it represents a |match| or
|end_match| command if and only if |match_token <= t <= end_match_token|.
The following definitions take care of these token-oriented constants
and a few others.

@ A token list is a singly linked list of one-word nodes in |mem|, where
each word contains a token and a link. Macro definitions, output-routine
definitions, marks, \.{\\write} texts, and a few other things
are remembered by \TeX\ in the form
of token lists, usually preceded by a node with a reference count in its
|token_ref_count| field. The token stored in location |p| is called
|info(p)|.

Three special commands appear in the token lists of macro definitions.
When |m==match|, it means that \TeX\ should scan a parameter
for the current macro; when |m==end_match|, it means that parameter
matching should end and \TeX\ should start reading the macro text; and
when |m==out_param|, it means that \TeX\ should insert parameter
number |c| into the text at this point.

The enclosing \.{\char'173} and \.{\char'175} characters of a macro
definition are omitted, but the final right brace of an output routine
is included at the end of its token list.

Here is an example macro definition that illustrates these conventions.
After \TeX\ processes the text
$$\.{\\def\\mac a\#1\#2 \\b \{\#1\\-a \#\#1\#2 \#2\}}$$
the definition of \.{\\mac} is represented as a token list containing
$$\def\,{\hskip2pt}
\vbox{\halign{\hfil#\hfil\cr
(reference count), |letter|\,\.a, |match|\,\#, |match|\,\#, |spacer|\,\.\ ,
\.{\\b}, |end_match|,\cr
|out_param|\,1, \.{\\-}, |letter|\,\.a, |spacer|\,\.\ , |mac_param|\,\#,
|other_char|\,\.1,\cr
|out_param|\,2, |spacer|\,\.\ , |out_param|\,2.\cr}}$$
The procedure |scan_toks| builds such token lists, and |macro_call|
does the parameter matching.
@^reference counts@>

Examples such as
$$\.{\\def\\m\{\\def\\m\{a\}\ b\}}$$
explain why reference counts would be needed even if \TeX\ had no \.{\\let}
operation: When the token list for \.{\\m} is being read, the redefinition of
\.{\\m} changes the |eqtb| entry before the token list has been fully
consumed, so we dare not simply destroy a token list when its
control sequence is being redefined.

If the parameter-matching part of a definition ends with `\.{\#\{}',
the corresponding token list will have `\.\{' just before the `|end_match|'
and also at the very end. The first `\.\{' is used to delimit the parameter; the
second one keeps the first from disappearing.

@ The procedure |show_token_list|, which prints a symbolic form of
the token list that starts at a given node |p|, illustrates these
conventions. The token list being displayed should not begin with a reference
count. However, the procedure is intended to be robust, so that if the
memory links are awry or if |p| is not really a pointer to a token list,
nothing catastrophic will happen.

An additional parameter |q| is also given; this parameter is either null
or it points to a node in the token list where a certain magic computation
takes place that will be explained later. (Basically, |q| is non-null when
we are printing the two-line context information at the time of an error
message; |q| marks the place corresponding to where the second line
should begin.)

For example, if |p| points to the node containing the first \.a in the
token list above, then |show_token_list| will print the string
$$\hbox{`\.{a\#1\#2\ \\b\ ->\#1\\-a\ \#\#1\#2\ \#2}';}$$
and if |q| points to the node containing the second \.a,
the magic computation will be performed just before the second \.a is printed.

The generation will stop, and `\.{\\ETC.}' will be printed, if the length
of printing exceeds a given limit~|l|. Anomalous entries are printed in the
form of control sequences that are not followed by a blank space, e.g.,
`\.{\\BAD.}'; this cannot be confused with actual control sequences because
a real control sequence named \.{BAD} would come out `\.{\\BAD\ }'.

@* Introduction to the syntactic routines.
Let's pause a moment now and try to look at the Big Picture.
The \TeX\ program consists of three main parts: syntactic routines,
semantic routines, and output routines. The chief purpose of the
syntactic routines is to deliver the user's input to the semantic routines,
one token at a time. The semantic routines act as an interpreter
responding to these tokens, which may be regarded as commands. And the
output routines are periodically called on to convert box-and-glue
lists into a compact set of instructions that will be sent
to a typesetter. We have discussed the basic data structures and utility
routines of \TeX, so we are good and ready to plunge into the real activity by
considering the syntactic routines.

Our current goal is to come to grips with the |get_next| procedure,
which is the keystone of \TeX's input mechanism. Each call of |get_next|
sets the value of three variables |cur_cmd|, |cur_chr|, and |cur_cs|,
representing the next input token.
$$\vbox{\halign{#\hfil\cr
  \hbox{|cur_cmd| denotes a command code from the long list of codes
   given above;}\cr
  \hbox{|cur_chr| denotes a character code or other modifier of the command
   code;}\cr
  \hbox{|cur_cs| is the |eqtb| location of the current control sequence,}\cr
  \hbox{\qquad if the current token was a control sequence,
   otherwise it's zero.}\cr}}$$
Underlying this external behavior of |get_next| is all the machinery
necessary to convert from character files to tokens. At a given time we
may be only partially finished with the reading of several files (for
which \.{\\input} was specified), and partially finished with the expansion
of some user-defined macros and/or some macro parameters, and partially
finished with the generation of some text in a template for \.{\\halign},
and so on. When reading a character file, special characters must be
classified as math delimiters, etc.; comments and extra blank spaces must
be removed, paragraphs must be recognized, and control sequences must be
found in the hash table. Furthermore there are occasions in which the
scanning routines have looked ahead for a word like `\.{plus}' but only
part of that word was found, hence a few characters must be put back
into the input and scanned again.

To handle these situations, which might all be present simultaneously,
\TeX\ uses various stacks that hold information about the incomplete
activities, and there is a finite state control for each level of the
input mechanism. These stacks record the current state of an implicitly
recursive process, but the |get_next| procedure is not recursive.
Therefore it will not be difficult to translate these algorithms into
low-level languages that do not support recursion.

@<Glob...@>=
eight_bits @!cur_cmd; /*current command set by |get_next|*/ 
halfword @!cur_chr; /*operand of current command*/ 
pointer @!cur_cs; /*control sequence found here, zero if none found*/ 
halfword @!cur_tok; /*packed representative of |cur_cmd| and |cur_chr|*/ 

@ The |print_cmd_chr| routine prints a symbolic interpretation of a
command code and its modifier. This is used in certain `\.{You can\'t}'
error messages, and in the implementation of diagnostic routines like
\.{\\show}.

The body of |print_cmd_chr| is a rather tedious listing of print
commands, and most of it is essentially an inverse to the |primitive|
routine that enters a \TeX\ primitive into |eqtb|. Therefore much of
this procedure appears elsewhere in the program,
together with the corresponding |primitive| calls.

end_diagnostic(false);
} 

@* Input stacks and states.
This implementation of
\TeX\ uses two different conventions for representing sequential stacks.
@^stack conventions@>@^conventions for representing stacks@>

\yskip\hangg 1) If there is frequent access to the top entry, and if the
stack is essentially never empty, then the top entry is kept in a global
variable (even better would be a machine register), and the other entries
appear in the array $\\{stack}[0\to(\\{ptr}-1)]$. For example, the
semantic stack described above is handled this way, and so is the input
stack that we are about to study.

\yskip\hangg 2) If there is infrequent top access, the entire stack contents
are in the array $\\{stack}[0\to(\\{ptr}-1)]$. For example, the |save_stack|
is treated this way, as we have seen.

\yskip\noindent
The state of \TeX's input mechanism appears in the input stack, whose
entries are records with six fields, called |state|, |index|, |start|, |loc|,
|limit|, and |name|. This stack is maintained with
convention~(1), so it is declared in the following way:

@<Types...@>=
typedef struct { 
  quarterword @!state_field, @!index_field;
  halfword @!start_field, @!loc_field, @!limit_field, @!name_field;
  } in_state_record;

@ @<Glob...@>=
in_state_record @!input_stack[stack_size+1];
uint8_t @!input_ptr; /*first unused location of |input_stack|*/ 
uint8_t @!max_in_stack; /*largest value of |input_ptr| when pushing*/ 
in_state_record @!cur_input;
   /*the ``top'' input state, according to convention (1)*/ 

@ We've already defined the special variable |loc====cur_input.loc_field|
in our discussion of basic input-output routines. The other components of
|cur_input| are defined in the same way:

@d state	cur_input.state_field /*current scanner state*/ 
@d index	cur_input.index_field /*reference for buffer information*/ 
@d start	cur_input.start_field /*starting position in |buffer|*/ 
@d limit	cur_input.limit_field /*end of current line in |buffer|*/ 
@d name	cur_input.name_field /*name of the current file*/ 

@ Let's look more closely now at the control variables
(|state|,~|index|,~|start|,~|loc|,~|limit|,~|name|),
assuming that \TeX\ is reading a line of characters that have been input
from some file or from the user's terminal. There is an array called
|buffer| that acts as a stack of all lines of characters that are
currently being read from files, including all lines on subsidiary
levels of the input stack that are not yet completed. \TeX\ will return to
the other lines when it is finished with the present input file.

(Incidentally, on a machine with byte-oriented addressing, it might be
appropriate to combine |buffer| with the |str_pool| array,
letting the buffer entries grow downward from the top of the string pool
and checking that these two tables don't bump into each other.)

The line we are currently working on begins in position |start| of the
buffer; the next character we are about to read is |buffer[loc]|; and
|limit| is the location of the last character present.  If |loc > limit|,
the line has been completely read. Usually |buffer[limit]| is the
|end_line_char|, denoting the end of a line, but this is not
true if the current line is an insertion that was entered on the user's
terminal in response to an error message.

The |name| variable is a string number that designates the name of
the current file, if we are reading a text file. It is zero if we
are reading from the terminal; it is |n+1| if we are reading from
input stream |n|, where |0 <= n <= 16|. (Input stream 16 stands for
an invalid stream number; in such cases the input is actually from
the terminal, under control of the procedure |read_toks|.)

The |state| variable has one of three values, when we are scanning such
files:
$$\baselineskip 15pt\vbox{\halign{#\hfil\cr
1) |state==mid_line| is the normal state.\cr
2) |state==skip_blanks| is like |mid_line|, but blanks are ignored.\cr
3) |state==new_line| is the state at the beginning of a line.\cr}}$$
These state values are assigned numeric codes so that if we add the state
code to the next character's command code, we get distinct values. For
example, `|mid_line+spacer|' stands for the case that a blank
space character occurs in the middle of a line when it is not being
ignored; after this case is processed, the next value of |state| will
be |skip_blanks|.

@d mid_line	1 /*|state| code when scanning a line of characters*/ 
@d skip_blanks	(2+max_char_code) /*|state| code when ignoring blanks*/ 
@d new_line	(3+max_char_code+max_char_code) /*|state| code at start of line*/ 

@ Additional information about the current line is available via the
|index| variable, which counts how many lines of characters are present
in the buffer below the current level. We have |index==0| when reading
from the terminal and prompting the user for each line; then if the user types,
e.g., `\.{\\input paper}', we will have |index==1| while reading
the file \.{paper.tex}. However, it does not follow that |index| is the
same as the input stack pointer, since many of the levels on the input
stack may come from token lists. For example, the instruction `\.{\\input
paper}' might occur in a token list.

The global variable |in_open| is equal to the |index|
value of the highest non-token-list level. Thus, the number of partially read
lines in the buffer is |in_open+1|, and we have |in_open==index|
when we are not reading a token list.

If we are not currently reading from the terminal, or from an input
stream, we are reading from the file variable |input_file[index]|. We use
the notation |terminal_input| as a convenient abbreviation for |name==0|,
and |cur_file| as an abbreviation for |input_file[index]|.

The global variable |line| contains the line number in the topmost
open file, for use in error messages. If we are not reading from
the terminal, |line_stack[index]| holds the line number for the
enclosing level, so that |line| can be restored when the current
file has been read. Line numbers should never be negative, since the
negative of the current line number is used to identify the user's output
routine in the |mode_line| field of the semantic nest entries.

If more information about the input state is needed, it can be
included in small arrays like those shown here. For example,
the current page or segment number in the input file might be
put into a variable |@!page|, maintained for enclosing levels in
`\ignorespaces|@!page_stack: array[1 dotdot max_in_open]int|\unskip'
by analogy with |line_stack|.
@^system dependencies@>

@d terminal_input	(name==0) /*are we reading from the terminal?*/ 
@d cur_file	input_file[index] /*the current |alpha_file| variable*/ 

@<Glob...@>=
uint8_t @!in_open; /*the number of lines in the buffer, less one*/ 
uint8_t @!open_parens; /*the number of open text files*/ 
alpha_file @!input_file0[max_in_open], *const @!input_file = @!input_file0-1;
int @!line; /*current line number in the current source file*/ 
int @!line_stack0[max_in_open], *const @!line_stack = @!line_stack0-1;

@ Users of \TeX\ sometimes forget to balance left and right braces properly,
and one of the ways \TeX\ tries to spot such errors is by considering an
input file as broken into subfiles by control sequences that
are declared to be \.{\\outer}.

A variable called |scanner_status| tells \TeX\ whether or not to complain
when a subfile ends. This variable has six possible values:

\yskip\hang|normal|, means that a subfile can safely end here without incident.

\yskip\hang|skipping|, means that a subfile can safely end here, but not a file,
because we're reading past some conditional text that was not selected.

\yskip\hang|defining|, means that a subfile shouldn't end now because a
macro is being defined.

\yskip\hang|matching|, means that a subfile shouldn't end now because a
macro is being used and we are searching for the end of its arguments.

\yskip\hang|aligning|, means that a subfile shouldn't end now because we are
not finished with the preamble of an \.{\\halign} or \.{\\valign}.

\yskip\hang|absorbing|, means that a subfile shouldn't end now because we are
reading a balanced token list for \.{\\message}, \.{\\write}, etc.

\yskip\noindent
If the |scanner_status| is not |normal|, the variable |warning_index| points
to the |eqtb| location for the relevant control sequence name to print
in an error message.

@d skipping	1 /*|scanner_status| when passing conditional text*/ 
@d defining	2 /*|scanner_status| when reading a macro definition*/ 
@d matching	3 /*|scanner_status| when reading macro arguments*/ 
@d aligning	4 /*|scanner_status| when reading an alignment preamble*/ 
@d absorbing	5 /*|scanner_status| when reading a balanced text*/ 

@<Glob...@>=
uint8_t @!scanner_status; /*can a subfile end now?*/ 
pointer @!warning_index; /*identifier relevant to non-|normal| scanner status*/ 
pointer @!def_ref; /*reference count of token list being defined*/ 

@ Here is a procedure that uses |scanner_status| to print a warning message
when a subfile has ended, and at certain other crucial times:

@<Declare the procedure called |runaway|@>=
void runaway(void)
{@+pointer p; /*head of runaway list*/ 
if (scanner_status > skipping) 
  {@+print_nl("Runaway ");
@.Runaway...@>
  switch (scanner_status) {
  case defining: {@+print_str("definition");p=def_ref;
    } @+break;
  case matching: {@+print_str("argument");p=temp_head;
    } @+break;
  case aligning: {@+print_str("preamble");p=hold_head;
    } @+break;
  case absorbing: {@+print_str("text");p=def_ref;
    } 
  }  /*there are no other cases*/ 
  print_char('?');print_ln();show_token_list(link(p), null, error_line-10);
  } 
} 

@ However, all this discussion about input state really applies only to the
case that we are inputting from a file. There is another important case,
namely when we are currently getting input from a token list. In this case
|state==token_list|, and the conventions about the other state variables
are different:

\yskip\hang|loc| is a pointer to the current node in the token list, i.e.,
the node that will be read next. If |loc==null|, the token list has been
fully read.

\yskip\hang|start| points to the first node of the token list; this node
may or may not contain a reference count, depending on the type of token
list involved.

\yskip\hang|token_type|, which takes the place of |index| in the
discussion above, is a code number that explains what kind of token list
is being scanned.

\yskip\hang|name| points to the |eqtb| address of the control sequence
being expanded, if the current token list is a macro.

\yskip\hang|param_start|, which takes the place of |limit|, tells where
the parameters of the current macro begin in the |param_stack|, if the
current token list is a macro.

\yskip\noindent The |token_type| can take several values, depending on
where the current token list came from:

\yskip\hang|parameter|, if a parameter is being scanned;

\hang|u_template|, if the \<u_j> part of an alignment
template is being scanned;

\hang|v_template|, if the \<v_j> part of an alignment
template is being scanned;

\hang|backed_up|, if the token list being scanned has been inserted as
`to be read again'.

\hang|inserted|, if the token list being scanned has been inserted as
the text expansion of a \.{\\count} or similar variable;

\hang|macro|, if a user-defined control sequence is being scanned;

\hang|output_text|, if an \.{\\output} routine is being scanned;

\hang|every_par_text|, if the text of \.{\\everypar} is being scanned;

\hang|every_math_text|, if the text of \.{\\everymath} is being scanned;

\hang|every_display_text|, if the text of \.{\\everydisplay} is being scanned;

\hang|every_hbox_text|, if the text of \.{\\everyhbox} is being scanned;

\hang|every_vbox_text|, if the text of \.{\\everyvbox} is being scanned;

\hang|every_job_text|, if the text of \.{\\everyjob} is being scanned;

\hang|every_cr_text|, if the text of \.{\\everycr} is being scanned;

\hang|mark_text|, if the text of a \.{\\mark} is being scanned;

\hang|write_text|, if the text of a \.{\\write} is being scanned.

\yskip\noindent
The codes for |output_text|, |every_par_text|, etc., are equal to a constant
plus the corresponding codes for token list parameters |output_routine_loc|,
|every_par_loc|, etc.  The token list begins with a reference count if and
only if |token_type >= macro|.

@ The |param_stack| is an auxiliary array used to hold pointers to the token
lists for parameters at the current level and subsidiary levels of input.

int @!max_param_stack;

@ The input routines must also interact with the processing of
\.{\\halign} and \.{\\valign}, since the appearance of tab marks and
\.{\\cr} in certain places is supposed to trigger the beginning of special
\<v_j> template text in the scanner. This magic is accomplished by an
|align_state| variable that is increased by~1 when a `\.{\char'173}' is
scanned and decreased by~1 when a `\.{\char'175}' is scanned. The |align_state|
is nonzero during the \<u_j> template, after which it is set to zero; the
\<v_j> template begins when a tab mark or \.{\\cr} occurs at a time that
|align_state==0|.

@<Glob...@>=
int @!align_state; /*group level with respect to current alignment*/ 

@ Thus, the ``current input state'' can be very complicated indeed; there
can be many levels and each level can arise in a variety of ways. The
|show_context| procedure, which is used by \TeX's error-reporting routine to

@ Here it is necessary to explain a little trick. We don't want to store a long
string that corresponds to a token list, because that string might take up
lots of memory; and we are printing during a time when an error message is
being given, so we dare not do anything that might overflow one of \TeX's
tables. So `pseudoprinting' is the answer: We enter a mode of printing
that stores characters into a buffer of length |error_line|, where character
$k+1$ is placed into \hbox{|trick_buf[k%error_line]|} if
|k < trick_count|, otherwise character |k| is dropped. Initially we set
|tally=0| and |trick_count=1000000|; then when we reach the
point where transition from line 1 to line 2 should occur, we
set |first_count=tally| and |trick_count=@tmax@>(error_line,
tally+1+error_line-half_error_line)|. At the end of the
pseudoprinting, the values of |first_count|, |tally|, and
|trick_count| give us all the information we need to print the two lines,
and all of the necessary text is in |trick_buf|.

Namely, let |l| be the length of the descriptive information that appears
on the first line. The length of the context information gathered for that
line is |k==first_count|, and the length of the context information
gathered for line~2 is $m=\min(|tally|, |trick_count|)-k$. If |l+k <= h|,
where |h==half_error_line|, we print |trick_buf[0 dotdot k-1]| after the
descriptive information on line~1, and set |n=l+k|; here |n| is the
length of line~1. If $l+k>h$, some cropping is necessary, so we set |n=h|
and print `\.{...}' followed by
$$\hbox{|trick_buf[(l+k-h+3)dotdot k-1]|,}$$
where subscripts of |trick_buf| are circular modulo |error_line|. The
second line consists of |n|~spaces followed by |trick_buf[k dotdot(k+m-1)]|,
unless |n+m > error_line|; in the latter case, further cropping is done.
This is easier to program than to explain.

@<Local variables for formatting...@>=
int @!i; /*index into |buffer|*/ 
uint16_t @!j; /*end of current line in |buffer|*/ 
uint8_t @!l; /*length of descriptive information on line 1*/ 
int @!m; /*context information gathered for line 2*/ 
uint8_t @!n; /*length of line 1*/ 
int @!p; /*starting or ending place in |trick_buf|*/ 
int @!q; /*temporary index*/ 

@ The following code sets up the print routines so that they will gather
the desired information.

@d begin_pseudoprint	
  {@+l=tally;tally=0;selector=pseudo;
  trick_count=1000000;

  {@+first_count=tally;
  trick_count=tally+1+error_line-half_error_line;
  if (trick_count < error_line) trick_count=error_line;
  } 

@ And the following code uses the information after it has been gathered.

@<Print two lines using the tricky pseudoprinted information@>=
if (trick_count==1000000) set_trick_count;
   /*|set_trick_count| must be performed*/

if (m+n > error_line) print_str("...")

@ But the trick is distracting us from our current goal, which is to
understand the input state. So let's concentrate on the data structures that
are being pseudoprinted as we finish up the |show_context| procedure.

@<Pseudoprint the line@>=

@ Here is the missing piece of |show_token_list| that is activated when the

@* Maintaining the input stacks.
The following subroutines change the input status in commonly needed ways.

First comes |push_input|, which stores the current state and creates a
new level (having, initially, the same properties as the old).

@d push_input	@t@> /*enter a new input level, save the old*/ 
  {@+if (input_ptr > max_in_stack) 
    {@+max_in_stack=input_ptr;

@:TeX capacity exceeded input stack size}{\quad input stack size@>
    } 
  input_stack[input_ptr]=cur_input; /*stack the record*/ 
  incr(input_ptr);
  } 

@ And of course what goes up must come down.

@d pop_input	@t@> /*leave an input level, re-enter the old*/ 
  {@+decr(input_ptr);cur_input=input_stack[input_ptr];
  } 

@ Here is a procedure that starts a new level of token-list input, given
a token list |p| and its type |t|. If |t==macro|, the calling routine should
set |name| and |loc|.

@d back_list(X)	begin_token_list(X, backed_up) /*backs up a simple token list*/ 
@d ins_list(X)	begin_token_list(X, inserted) /*inserts a simple token list*/

    } 
  } 
else loc=p;
} 

@ When a token list has been fully scanned, the following computations

@ Sometimes \TeX\ has read too far and wants to ``unscan'' what it has
seen. The |back_input| procedure takes care of this by putting the token
just scanned back into the input stream, ready to be read again. This
procedure can be used only if |cur_tok| represents the token to be
replaced. Some applications of \TeX\ use this procedure a lot,
so it has been slightly optimized for speed.

@* Getting the next token.
The heart of \TeX's input mechanism is the |get_next| procedure, which
we shall develop in the next few sections of the program. Perhaps we
shouldn't actually call it the ``heart,'' however, because it really acts
as \TeX's eyes and mouth, reading the source files and gobbling them up.
And it also helps \TeX\ to regurgitate stored token lists that are to be
processed again.
@^eyes and mouth@>

The main duty of |get_next| is to input one token and to set |cur_cmd|
and |cur_chr| to that token's command code and modifier. Furthermore, if
the input token is a control sequence, the |eqtb| location of that control
sequence is stored in |cur_cs|; otherwise |cur_cs| is set to zero.

Underlying this simple description is a certain amount of complexity
because of all the cases that need to be handled.
However, the inner loop of |get_next| is reasonably short and fast.

When |get_next| is asked to get the next token of a \.{\\read} line,
it sets |cur_cmd==cur_chr==cur_cs==0| in the case that no more tokens
appear on that line. (There might not be any tokens at all, if the
|end_line_char| has |ignore| as its catcode.)

@ The value of |par_loc| is the |eqtb| address of `\.{\\par}'. This quantity
is needed because a blank line of input is supposed to be exactly equivalent
to the appearance of \.{\\par}; we must set |cur_cs=par_loc|
when detecting a blank line.

@ Control sequence names are scanned only when they appear in some line of
a file; once they have been scanned the first time, their |eqtb| location
serves as a unique identification, so \TeX\ doesn't need to refer to the
original name any more except when it prints the equivalent in symbolic form.

The program that scans a control sequence has been written carefully
in order to avoid the blowups that might otherwise occur if a malicious
user tried something like `\.{\\catcode\'15=0}'. The algorithm might
look at |buffer[limit+1]|, but it never looks at |buffer[limit+2]|.

If expanded characters like `\.{\^\^A}' or `\.{\^\^df}'
appear in or just following
a control sequence name, they are converted to single characters in the
buffer and the process is repeated, slowly but surely.

@ Since |get_next| is used so frequently in \TeX, it is convenient
to define three related procedures that do a little more:

\yskip\hang|get_token| not only sets |cur_cmd| and |cur_chr|, it
also sets |cur_tok|, a packed halfword version of the current token.

\yskip\hang|get_x_token|, meaning ``get an expanded token,'' is like
|get_token|, but if the current token turns out to be a user-defined
control sequence (i.e., a macro call), or a conditional,
or something like \.{\\topmark} or \.{\\expandafter} or \.{\\csname},
it is eliminated from the input by beginning the expansion of the macro
or the evaluation of the conditional.

\yskip\hang|x_token| is like |get_x_token| except that it assumes that
|get_next| has already been called.

\yskip\noindent
In fact, these three procedures account for almost every use of |get_next|.

@ No new control sequences will be defined except during a call of
|get_token|, or when \.{\\csname} compresses a token list, because
|no_new_control_sequence| is always |true| at other times.

@p void get_token(void) /*sets |cur_cmd|, |cur_chr|, |cur_tok|*/ 
{@+no_new_control_sequence=false;get_next();no_new_control_sequence=true;
@^inner loop@>
if (cur_cs==0) cur_tok=(cur_cmd*0400)+cur_chr;
else cur_tok=cs_token_flag+cur_cs;
} 

@* Expanding the next token.
Only a dozen or so command codes | > max_command| can possibly be returned by
|get_next|; in increasing order, they are |undefined_cs|, |expand_after|,
|no_expand|, |input|, |if_test|, |fi_or_else|, |cs_name|, |convert|, |the|,
|top_bot_mark|, |call|, |long_call|, |outer_call|, |long_outer_call|, and
|end_template|.{\emergencystretch=40pt\par}

The |expand| subroutine is used when |cur_cmd > max_command|. It removes a
``call'' or a conditional or one of the other special operations just
listed.  It follows that |expand| might invoke itself recursively. In all
cases, |expand| destroys the current token, but it sets things up so that
the next |get_next| will deliver the appropriate next token. The value of
|cur_tok| need not be known when |expand| is called.

Since several of the basic scanning routines communicate via global variables,
their values are saved as local variables of |expand| so that
recursive calls don't invalidate them.

@ Now let's consider |macro_call| itself, which is invoked when \TeX\ is
scanning a control sequence whose |cur_cmd| is either |call|, |long_call|,
|outer_call|, or |long_outer_call|.  The control sequence definition
appears in the token list whose reference count is in location |cur_chr|
of |mem|.

The global variable |long_state| will be set to |call| or to |long_call|,
depending on whether or not the control sequence disallows \.{\\par}
in its parameters. The |get_next| routine will set |long_state| to
|outer_call| and emit \.{\\par}, if a file ends or if an \.{\\outer}
control sequence occurs in the midst of an argument.

@<Glob...@>=
uint8_t @!long_state; /*governs the acceptance of \.{\\par}*/ 

@ The parameters, if any, must be scanned before the macro is expanded.
Parameters are token lists without reference counts. They are placed on
an auxiliary stack called |pstack| while they are being scanned, since
the |param_stack| may be losing entries during the matching process.
(Note that |param_stack| can't be gaining entries, since |macro_call| is
the only routine that puts anything onto |param_stack|, and it
is not recursive.)

@<Glob...@>=
pointer @!pstack[9]; /*arguments supplied to a macro*/ 

@ After parameter scanning is complete, the parameters are moved to the
|param_stack|. Then the macro body is fed to the scanner; in other words,
|macro_call| places the defined text of the control sequence at the
top of\/ \TeX's input stack, so that |get_next| will proceed to read it
next.

The global variable |cur_cs| contains the |eqtb| address of the control sequence
being expanded, when |macro_call| begins. If this control sequence has not been
declared \.{\\long}, i.e., if its command code in the |eq_type| field is
not |long_call| or |long_outer_call|, its parameters are not allowed to contain
the control sequence \.{\\par}. If an illegal \.{\\par} appears, the macro
call is aborted, and the \.{\\par} will be rescanned.

@ At this point, the reader will find it advisable to review the explanation
of token list format that was presented earlier, since many aspects of that
format are of importance chiefly in the |macro_call| routine.

The token list might begin with a string of compulsory tokens before the
first |match| or |end_match|. In that case the macro name is supposed to be
followed by those tokens; the following program will set |s==null| to
represent this restriction. Otherwise |s| will be set to the first token of
a string that will delimit the next parameter.

@<Scan the parameters and make |link(r)| point to the macro body...@>=

} 

@ If |info(r)| is a |match| or |end_match| command, it cannot be equal to
any token found by |get_token|. Therefore an undelimited parameter---i.e.,
a |match| that is immediately followed by |match| or |end_match|---will
always fail the test `|cur_tok==info(r)|' in the following algorithm.

with `\.{\#\{}', the token list will have a left brace both before and
after the |end_match|\kern-.4pt. Only one of these should affect the

@ When the following code becomes active, we have matched tokens from |s| to
the predecessor of |r|, and we have found that |cur_tok!=info(r)|. An
interesting situation now presents itself: If the parameter is to be
delimited by a string such as `\.{ab}', and if we have scanned `\.{aa}',
we want to contribute one `\.a' to the current parameter and resume
looking for a `\.b'. The program must account for such partial matches and
for others that can be quite complex.  But most of the time we have |s==r|
and nothing needs to be done.

Incidentally, it is possible for \.{\\par} tokens to sneak in to certain
parameters of non-\.{\\long} macros. For example, consider a case like
`\.{\\def\\a\#1\\par!\{...\}}' where the first \.{\\par} is not followed
by an exclamation point. In such situations it does not seem appropriate
to prohibit the \.{\\par}, so \TeX\ keeps quiet about this bending of
the rules.

@* Basic scanning subroutines.
Let's turn now to some procedures that \TeX\ calls upon frequently to digest
certain kinds of patterns in the input. Most of these are quite simple;
some are quite elaborate. Almost all of the routines call |get_x_token|,
which can cause them to be invoked recursively.
@^stomach@>
@^recursion@>

@ The |scan_left_brace| routine is called when a left brace is supposed to be
the next non-blank token. (The term ``left brace'' means, more precisely,
a character whose catcode is |left_brace|.) \TeX\ allows \.{\\relax} to
appear before the |left_brace|.

@p void scan_left_brace(void) /*reads a mandatory |left_brace|*/ 
{@+@<Get the next non-blank non-relax non-call token@>;
if (cur_cmd!=left_brace) 
  {@+print_err("Missing { inserted");

    ("You might want to delete and/or insert some corrections")@/

  back_error();cur_tok=left_brace_token+'{';cur_cmd=left_brace;
  cur_chr='{';incr(align_state);
  } 
} 

@ @<Get the next non-blank non-relax non-call token@>=
@/do@+{get_x_token();
}@+ while (!((cur_cmd!=spacer)&&(cur_cmd!=relax)))

@ The |scan_optional_equals| routine looks for an optional `\.=' sign preceded
by optional spaces; `\.{\\relax}' is not ignored here.

if (cur_tok!=other_token+'=') back_input();
} 

@ @<Get the next non-blank non-call token@>=
@/do@+{get_x_token();
}@+ while (!(cur_cmd!=spacer))

@ In case you are getting bored, here is a slightly less trivial routine:
Given a string of lowercase letters, like `\.{pt}' or `\.{plus}' or
`\.{width}', the |scan_keyword| routine checks to see whether the next
tokens of input match this string. The match must be exact, except that
uppercase letters will match their lowercase counterparts; uppercase
equivalents are determined by subtracting |'a'-'A'|, rather than using the
|uc_code| table, since \TeX\ uses this routine only for its own limited
set of keywords.

If a match is found, the characters are effectively removed from the input
and |true| is returned. Otherwise |false| is returned, and the input
is left essentially unchanged (except for the fact that some macros
may have been expanded, etc.).

@ The next routine `|scan_something_internal|' is used to fetch internal
numeric quantities like `\.{\\hsize}', and also to handle the `\.{\\the}'
when expanding constructions like `\.{\\the\\toks0}' and
`\.{\\the\\baselineskip}'. Soon we will be considering the |scan_int|
procedure, which calls |scan_something_internal|; on the other hand,
|scan_something_internal| also calls |scan_int|, for constructions like
`\.{\\catcode\`\\\$}' or `\.{\\fontdimen} \.3 \.{\\ff}'. So we
have to declare |scan_int| as a |forward| procedure. A few other
procedures are also declared at this point.

@p void scan_int(void); /*scans an integer value*/ 
@t\4\4@>@<Declare procedures that scan restricted classes of integers@>@;
@t\4\4@>@<Declare procedures that scan font-related stuff@>@;

@ \TeX\ doesn't know exactly what to expect when |scan_something_internal|
begins.  For example, an integer or dimension or glue value could occur
immediately after `\.{\\hskip}'; and one can even say \.{\\the} with
respect to token lists in constructions like
`\.{\\xdef\\o\{\\the\\output\}}'.  On the other hand, only integers are
allowed after a construction like `\.{\\count}'. To handle the various
possibilities, |scan_something_internal| has a |level| parameter, which
tells the ``highest'' kind of quantity that |scan_something_internal| is
allowed to produce. Six levels are distinguished, namely |int_val|,
|dimen_val|, |glue_val|, |mu_val|, |ident_val|, and |tok_val|.

The output of |scan_something_internal| (and of the other routines
|scan_int|, |scan_dimen|, and |scan_glue| below) is put into the global
variable |cur_val|, and its level is put into |cur_val_level|. The highest
values of |cur_val_level| are special: |mu_val| is used only when
|cur_val| points to something in a ``muskip'' register, or to one of the
three parameters \.{\\thinmuskip}, \.{\\medmuskip}, \.{\\thickmuskip};
|ident_val| is used only when |cur_val| points to a font identifier;
|tok_val| is used only when |cur_val| points to |null| or to the reference
count of a token list. The last two cases are allowed only when
|scan_something_internal| is called with |level==tok_val|.

If the output is glue, |cur_val| will point to a glue specification, and
the reference count of that glue will have been updated to reflect this
reference; if the output is a nonempty token list, |cur_val| will point to
its reference count, but in this case the count will not have been updated.
Otherwise |cur_val| will contain the integer or scaled value in question.

@ The |scan_dimen| routine is similar to |scan_int|, but it sets |cur_val| to
a |scaled| value, i.e., an integral number of sp. One of its main tasks
is therefore to interpret the abbreviations for various kinds of units and
to convert measurements to scaled points.

There are three parameters: |mu| is |true| if the finite units must be
`\.{mu}', while |mu| is |false| if `\.{mu}' units are disallowed;
|inf| is |true| if the infinite units `\.{fil}', `\.{fill}', `\.{filll}'
are permitted; and |shortcut| is |true| if |cur_val| already contains
an integer and only the units need to be considered.

The order of infinity that was found in the case of infinite glue is returned
in the global variable |cur_order|.

@<Glob...@>=
glue_ord @!cur_order; /*order of infinity found by |scan_dimen|*/ 

@ Constructions like `\.{-\'77 pt}' are legal dimensions, so |scan_dimen|
may begin with |scan_int|. This explains why it is convenient to use
|scan_int| also for the integer part of a decimal fraction.

Several branches of |scan_dimen| work with |cur_val| as an integer and
with an auxiliary fraction |f|, so that the actual quantity of interest is
$|cur_val|+|f|/2^{16}$. At the end of the routine, this ``unpacked''
representation is put into the single word |cur_val|, which suddenly
switches significance from |int| to |scaled|.

@ The final member of \TeX's value-scanning trio is |scan_glue|, which
makes |cur_val| point to a glue specification. The reference count of that
glue spec will take account of the fact that |cur_val| is pointing to~it.

The |level| parameter should be either |glue_val| or |mu_val|.

Since |scan_dimen| was so much more complex than |scan_int|, we might expect
|scan_glue| to be even worse. But fortunately, it is very simple, since
most of the work has already been done.

@ Here's a similar procedure that returns a pointer to a rule node. This
routine is called just after \TeX\ has seen \.{\\hrule} or \.{\\vrule};
therefore |cur_cmd| will be either |hrule| or |vrule|. The idea is to store
the default rule dimensions in the node, then to override them if
`\.{height}' or `\.{width}' or `\.{depth}' specifications are
found (in any order).

@* Building token lists.
The token lists for macros and for other things like \.{\\mark} and \.{\\output}
and \.{\\write} are produced by a procedure called |scan_toks|.

Before we get into the details of |scan_toks|, let's consider a much
simpler task, that of converting the current string into a token list.
The |str_toks| function does this; it classifies spaces as type |spacer|
and everything else as type |other_char|.

The token list created by |str_toks| begins at |link(temp_head)| and ends
at the value |p| that is returned. (If |p==temp_head|, the list is empty.)

@p pointer str_toks(pool_pointer @!b)
   /*changes the string |str_pool[b dotdot pool_ptr]| to a token list*/ 
{@+pointer p; /*tail of the token list*/ 
pointer @!q; /*new node being added to the token list via |store_new_token|*/ 
halfword @!t; /*token being appended*/ 
pool_pointer @!k; /*index into |str_pool|*/ 
str_room(1);
p=temp_head;link(p)=null;k=b;
while (k < pool_ptr) 
  {@+t=so(str_pool[k]);
  if (t==' ') t=space_token;
  else t=other_token+t;
  fast_store_new_token(t);
  incr(k);
  } 
pool_ptr=b;return p;
} 

@ The main reason for wanting |str_toks| is the next function,
|the_toks|, which has similar input/output characteristics.

This procedure is supposed to scan something like `\.{\\skip\\count12}',
i.e., whatever can follow `\.{\\the}', and it constructs a token list
containing something like `\.{-3.0pt minus 0.5fill}'.

@ Now we can't postpone the difficulties any longer; we must bravely tackle
|scan_toks|. This function returns a pointer to the tail of a new token
list, and it also makes |def_ref| point to the reference count at the
head of that list.

There are two boolean parameters, |macro_def| and |xpand|. If |macro_def|
is true, the goal is to create the token list for a macro definition;
otherwise the goal is to create the token list for some other \TeX\
primitive: \.{\\mark}, \.{\\output}, \.{\\everypar}, \.{\\lowercase},
\.{\\uppercase}, \.{\\message}, \.{\\errmessage}, \.{\\write}, or
\.{\\special}. In the latter cases a left brace must be scanned next; this
left brace will not be part of the token list, nor will the matching right
brace that comes at the end. If |xpand| is false, the token list will
simply be copied from the input using |get_token|. Otherwise all expandable
tokens will be expanded until unexpandable tokens are left, except that
the results of expanding `\.{\\the}' are not expanded further.
If both |macro_def| and |xpand| are true, the expansion applies
only to the macro body (i.e., to the material following the first
|left_brace| character).

The value of |cur_cs| when |scan_toks| begins should be the |eqtb|
address of the control sequence to display in ``runaway'' error
messages.

@ Conditions can be inside conditions, and this nesting has a stack
that is independent of the |save_stack|.

Four global variables represent the top of the condition stack:
|cond_ptr| points to pushed-down entries, if any; |if_limit| specifies
the largest code of a |fi_or_else| command that is syntactically legal;
|cur_if| is the name of the current type of conditional; and |if_line|
is the line number at which it began.

If no conditions are currently in progress, the condition stack has the
special state |cond_ptr==null|, |if_limit==normal|, |cur_if==0|, |if_line==0|.
Otherwise |cond_ptr| points to a two-word node; the |type|, |subtype|, and
|link| fields of the first word contain |if_limit|, |cur_if|, and
|cond_ptr| at the next level, and the second word contains the
corresponding |if_line|.

@* File names.
It's time now to fret about file names.  Besides the fact that different
operating systems treat files in different ways, we must cope with the
fact that completely different naming conventions are used by different
groups of people. The following programs show what is required for one
particular operating system; similar routines for other systems are not
difficult to devise.
@^fingers@>
@^system dependencies@>

\TeX\ assumes that a file name has three parts: the name proper; its
``extension''; and a ``file area'' where it is found in an external file
system.  The extension of an input file or a write file is assumed to be
`\.{.tex}' unless otherwise specified; it is `\.{.log}' on the
transcript file that records each run of \TeX; it is `\.{.tfm}' on the font
metric files that describe characters in the fonts \TeX\ uses; it is
`\.{.dvi}' on the output files that specify typesetting information; and it
is `\.{.fmt}' on the format files written by \.{INITEX} to initialize \TeX.
The file area can be arbitrary on input files, but files are usually
output to the user's current area.  If an input file cannot be
found on the specified area, \TeX\ will look for it on a special system
area; this special area is intended for commonly used input files like
\.{webmac.tex}.

Simple uses of \TeX\ refer only to file names that have no explicit
extension or area. For example, a person usually says `\.{\\input} \.{paper}'
or `\.{\\font\\tenrm} \.= \.{helvetica}' instead of `\.{\\input}
\.{paper.new}' or `\.{\\font\\tenrm} \.= \.{<csd.knuth>test}'. Simple file
names are best, because they make the \TeX\ source files portable;
whenever a file name consists entirely of letters and digits, it should be
treated in the same way by all implementations of \TeX. However, users
need the ability to refer to other files in their environment, especially
when responding to error messages concerning unopenable files; therefore
we want to let them use the syntax that appears in their favorite
operating system.

The following procedures don't allow spaces to be part of
file names; but some users seem to like names that are spaced-out.
System-dependent changes to allow such things should probably
be made with reluctance, and only when an entire file name that
includes spaces is ``quoted'' somehow.

@ In order to isolate the system-dependent aspects of file names, the
@^system dependencies@>
system-independent parts of \TeX\ are expressed in terms
of three system-dependent
procedures called |begin_name|, |more_name|, and |end_name|. In
essence, if the user-specified characters of the file name are $c_1\ldots c_n$,
the system-independent driver program does the operations
$$|begin_name|;\,|more_name|(c_1);\,\ldots\,;\,|more_name|(c_n);
\,|end_name|.$$
These three procedures communicate with each other via global variables.
Afterwards the file name will appear in the string pool as three strings
called |cur_name|\penalty10000\hskip-.05em,
|cur_area|, and |cur_ext|; the latter two are null (i.e.,
|empty_string|), unless they were explicitly specified by the user.

Actually the situation is slightly more complicated, because \TeX\ needs
to know when the file name ends. The |more_name| routine is a function
(with side effects) that returns |true| on the calls |more_name|$(c_1)$,
\dots, |more_name|$(c_{n-1})$. The final call |more_name|$(c_n)$
returns |false|; or, it returns |true| and the token following $c_n$ is
something like `\.{\\hbox}' (i.e., not a character). In other words,
|more_name| is supposed to return |true| unless it is sure that the
file name has been completely scanned; and |end_name| is supposed to be able
to finish the assembly of |cur_name|, |cur_area|, and |cur_ext| regardless of
whether $|more_name|(c_n)$ returned |true| or |false|.

@<Glob...@>=
str_number @!cur_name; /*name of file just scanned*/ 
str_number @!cur_area; /*file area just scanned, or \.{""}*/ 
str_number @!cur_ext; /*file extension just scanned, or \.{""}*/ 

@ The file names we shall deal with for illustrative purposes have the
following structure:  If the name contains `\.>' or `\.:', the file area
consists of all characters up to and including the final such character;
otherwise the file area is null.  If the remaining file name contains
`\..', the file extension consists of all such characters from the first
remaining `\..' to the end, otherwise the file extension is null.
@^system dependencies@>

We can scan such file names easily by using two global variables that keep track
of the occurrences of area and extension delimiters:

@<Glob...@>=
pool_pointer @!area_delimiter; /*the most recent `\.>' or `\.:', if any*/ 
pool_pointer @!ext_delimiter; /*the relevant `\..', if any*/ 

@ Input files that can't be found in the user's area may appear in a standard
system area called |TEX_area|. Font metric files whose areas are not given
explicitly are assumed to appear in a standard system area called
|TEX_font_area|.  These system area names will, of course, vary from place
to place.
@^system dependencies@>
@.TeXinputs@>
@.TeXfonts@>

@ Here now is the first of the system-dependent routines for file name scanning.
@^system dependencies@>

@p void begin_name(void)
{@+area_delimiter=0;ext_delimiter=0;
} 

@ And here's the second. The string pool might change as the file name is
being scanned, since a new \.{\\csname} might be entered; therefore we keep
|area_delimiter| and |ext_delimiter| relative to the beginning of the current
string, instead of assigning an absolute address like |pool_ptr| to them.
@^system dependencies@>

@p bool more_name(ASCII_code @!c)
{@+if (c==' ') return false;

  if ((c=='>')||(c==':')) 
    {@+area_delimiter=cur_length;ext_delimiter=0;
    } 
  else if ((c=='.')&&(ext_delimiter==0)) ext_delimiter=cur_length;
  return true;
  } 
} 

@ The third.
@^system dependencies@>

@p void end_name(void)
{@+if (str_ptr+3 > max_strings) 
  overflow("number of strings", max_strings-init_str_ptr);
@:TeX capacity exceeded number of strings}{\quad number of strings@>
if (area_delimiter==0) cur_area=empty_string;

  str_start[str_ptr+1]=str_start[str_ptr]+ext_delimiter-area_delimiter-1;
  incr(str_ptr);cur_ext=make_string();
  } 
} 

@ Conversely, here is a routine that takes three strings and prints a file
name that might have produced them. (The routine is system dependent, because
some operating systems put the file area last instead of first.)

@ Operating systems often make it possible to determine the exact name (and

which simply makes a \TeX\ string from the value of |name_of_file|, should
ideally be changed to deduce the full name of file~|f|, which is the file
most recently opened, if it is possible to do this in a \PASCAL\ program.
@^system dependencies@>

This routine might be called after string memory has overflowed, hence
we dare not use `|str_room|'.

@ Now let's consider the ``driver''
routines by which \TeX\ deals with file names
in a system-independent manner.  First comes a procedure that looks for a
file name in the input by calling |get_x_token| for the information.

@p void scan_file_name(void)

  get_x_token();
  } 
done: end_name();name_in_progress=false;
} 

@ The global variable |name_in_progress| is used to prevent recursive
use of |scan_file_name|, since the |begin_name| and other procedures
communicate via global variables. Recursion would arise only by
devious tricks like `\.{\\input\\input f}'; such attempts at sabotage
must be thwarted. Furthermore, |name_in_progress| prevents \.{\\input}
@^recursion@>
from being initiated when a font size specification is being scanned.

Another global variable, |job_name|, contains the file name that was first
\.{\\input} by the user. This name is extended by `\.{.log}' and `\.{.dvi}'
and `\.{.fmt}' in the names of \TeX's output files.

@<Glob...@>=

@ Initially |job_name==0|; it becomes nonzero as soon as the true name is known.
We have |job_name==0| if and only if the `\.{log}' file has not been opened,
except of course for a short time just after |job_name| has become nonzero.

@<Initialize the output...@>=

The normal idea of |batch_mode| is that nothing at all should be written
on the terminal. However, in the unusual case that
no log file could be opened, we make an exception and allow
an explanatory message to be seen.

Incidentally, the program always refers to the log file as a `\.{transcript
file}', because some systems cannot use the extension `\.{.log}' for
this file.

@* Font metric data.
\TeX\ gets its knowledge about fonts from font metric files, also called
\.{TFM} files; the `\.T' in `\.{TFM}' stands for \TeX,
but other programs know about them too.
@:TFM files}{\.{TFM} files@>
@^font metric files@>

The information in a \.{TFM} file appears in a sequence of 8-bit bytes.
Since the number of bytes is always a multiple of 4, we could
also regard the file as a sequence of 32-bit words, but \TeX\ uses the
byte interpretation. The format of \.{TFM} files was designed by
Lyle Ramshaw in 1980. The intent is to convey a lot of different kinds
@^Ramshaw, Lyle Harold@>
of information in a compact but useful form.

@<Glob...@>=
byte_file @!tfm_file;

@ The first 24 bytes (6 words) of a \.{TFM} file contain twelve 16-bit
integers that give the lengths of the various subsequent portions
of the file. These twelve integers are, in order:
$$\vbox{\halign{\hfil#&$\null=\null$#\hfil\cr
|lf|&length of the entire file, in words;\cr
|lh|&length of the header data, in words;\cr
|bc|&smallest character code in the font;\cr
|ec|&largest character code in the font;\cr
|nw|&number of words in the width table;\cr
|nh|&number of words in the height table;\cr
|nd|&number of words in the depth table;\cr
|ni|&number of words in the italic correction table;\cr
|nl|&number of words in the lig/kern table;\cr
|nk|&number of words in the kern table;\cr
|ne|&number of words in the extensible character table;\cr
|np|&number of font parameter words.\cr}}$$
They are all nonnegative and less than $2^{15}$. We must have |bc-1 <= ec <= 255|,
and
$$\hbox{|lf==6+lh+(ec-bc+1)+nw+nh+nd+ni+nl+nk+ne+np|.}$$
Note that a font may contain as many as 256 characters (if |bc==0| and |ec==255|),
and as few as 0 characters (if |bc==ec+1|).

Incidentally, when two or more 8-bit bytes are combined to form an integer of
16 or more bits, the most significant bytes appear first in the file.
This is called BigEndian order.
@!@^BigEndian order@>

@ The rest of the \.{TFM} file may be regarded as a sequence of ten data
arrays having the informal specification
$$\def\arr$[#1]#2${\&{array} $[#1]$ \&{of} #2}
\def\PB#1{\arr#1}
\vbox{\halign{\hfil\\{#}&$\,:\,$#\hfil\cr
header&|[0 dotdot lh-1]@t\\{stuff}@>|\cr
char\_info&|[bc dotdot ec]char_info_word|\cr
width&|[0 dotdot nw-1]fix_word|\cr
height&|[0 dotdot nh-1]fix_word|\cr
depth&|[0 dotdot nd-1]fix_word|\cr
italic&|[0 dotdot ni-1]fix_word|\cr
lig\_kern&|[0 dotdot nl-1]lig_kern_command|\cr
kern&|[0 dotdot nk-1]fix_word|\cr
exten&|[0 dotdot ne-1]extensible_recipe|\cr
param&|[1 dotdot np]fix_word|\cr}}$$
The most important data type used here is a |@!fix_word|, which is
a 32-bit representation of a binary fraction. A |fix_word| is a signed
quantity, with the two's complement of the entire word used to represent
negation. Of the 32 bits in a |fix_word|, exactly 12 are to the left of the
binary point; thus, the largest |fix_word| value is $2048-2^{-20}$, and
the smallest is $-2048$. We will see below, however, that all but two of
the |fix_word| values must lie between $-16$ and $+16$.

@ The first data array is a block of header information, which contains
general facts about the font. The header must contain at least two words,
|header[0]| and |header[1]|, whose meaning is explained below.
Additional header information of use to other software routines might
also be included, but \TeX82 does not need to know about such details.
For example, 16 more words of header information are in use at the Xerox
Palo Alto Research Center; the first ten specify the character coding
scheme used (e.g., `\.{XEROX text}' or `\.{TeX math symbols}'), the next five
give the font identifier (e.g., `\.{HELVETICA}' or `\.{CMSY}'), and the
last gives the ``face byte.'' The program that converts \.{DVI} files
to Xerox printing format gets this information by looking at the \.{TFM}
file, which it needs to read anyway because of other information that
is not explicitly repeated in \.{DVI}~format.

\yskip\hang|header[0]| is a 32-bit check sum that \TeX\ will copy into
the \.{DVI} output file. Later on when the \.{DVI} file is printed,
possibly on another computer, the actual font that gets used is supposed
to have a check sum that agrees with the one in the \.{TFM} file used by
\TeX. In this way, users will be warned about potential incompatibilities.
(However, if the check sum is zero in either the font file or the \.{TFM}
file, no check is made.)  The actual relation between this check sum and
the rest of the \.{TFM} file is not important; the check sum is simply an
identification number with the property that incompatible fonts almost
always have distinct check sums.
@^check sum@>

\yskip\hang|header[1]| is a |fix_word| containing the design size of
the font, in units of \TeX\ points. This number must be at least 1.0; it is
fairly arbitrary, but usually the design size is 10.0 for a ``10 point''
font, i.e., a font that was designed to look best at a 10-point size,
whatever that really means. When a \TeX\ user asks for a font
`\.{at} $\delta$ \.{pt}', the effect is to override the design size
and replace it by $\delta$, and to multiply the $x$ and~$y$ coordinates
of the points in the font image by a factor of $\delta$ divided by the
design size.  {\sl All other dimensions in the\/ \.{TFM} file are
|fix_word|\kern-1pt\ numbers in design-size units}, with the exception of
|param[1]| (which denotes the slant ratio). Thus, for example, the value
of |param[6]|, which defines the \.{em} unit, is often the |fix_word| value
$2^{20}=1.0$, since many fonts have a design size equal to one em.
The other dimensions must be less than 16 design-size units in absolute
value; thus, |header[1]| and |param[1]| are the only |fix_word|
entries in the whole \.{TFM} file whose first byte might be something
besides 0 or 255.

@ Next comes the |char_info| array, which contains one |@!char_info_word|
per character. Each word in this part of the file contains six fields
packed into four bytes as follows.

\yskip\hang first byte: |@!width_index| (8 bits)\par
\hang second byte: |@!height_index| (4 bits) times 16, plus |@!depth_index|
  (4~bits)\par
\hang third byte: |@!italic_index| (6 bits) times 4, plus |@!tag|
  (2~bits)\par
\hang fourth byte: |@!rem| (8 bits)\par
\yskip\noindent
The actual width of a character is \\{width}|[width_index]|, in design-size
units; this is a device for compressing information, since many characters
have the same width. Since it is quite common for many characters
to have the same height, depth, or italic correction, the \.{TFM} format
imposes a limit of 16 different heights, 16 different depths, and
64 different italic corrections.

@!@^italic correction@>
The italic correction of a character has two different uses.
(a)~In ordinary text, the italic correction is added to the width only if
the \TeX\ user specifies `\.{\\/}' after the character.
(b)~In math formulas, the italic correction is always added to the width,
except with respect to the positioning of subscripts.

Incidentally, the relation $\\{width}[0]=\\{height}[0]=\\{depth}[0]=
\\{italic}[0]=0$ should always hold, so that an index of zero implies a
value of zero.  The |width_index| should never be zero unless the
character does not exist in the font, since a character is valid if and
only if it lies between |bc| and |ec| and has a nonzero |width_index|.

@ The |tag| field in a |char_info_word| has four values that explain how to
interpret the |rem| field.

\yskip\hangg|tag==0| (|no_tag|) means that |rem| is unused.\par
\hangg|tag==1| (|lig_tag|) means that this character has a ligature/kerning
program starting at position |rem| in the |lig_kern| array.\par
\hangg|tag==2| (|list_tag|) means that this character is part of a chain of
characters of ascending sizes, and not the largest in the chain.  The
|rem| field gives the character code of the next larger character.\par
\hangg|tag==3| (|ext_tag|) means that this character code represents an
extensible character, i.e., a character that is built up of smaller pieces
so that it can be made arbitrarily large. The pieces are specified in
|@!exten[rem]|.\par
\yskip\noindent
Characters with |tag==2| and |tag==3| are treated as characters with |tag==0|
unless they are used in special circumstances in math formulas. For example,
the \.{\\sum} operation looks for a |list_tag|, and the \.{\\left}
operation looks for both |list_tag| and |ext_tag|.

@d no_tag	0 /*vanilla character*/ 
@d lig_tag	1 /*character has a ligature/kerning program*/ 
@d list_tag	2 /*character has a successor in a charlist*/ 
@d ext_tag	3 /*character is extensible*/ 

@ The |lig_kern| array contains instructions in a simple programming language
that explains what to do for special letter pairs. Each word in this array is a
|@!lig_kern_command| of four bytes.

\yskip\hang first byte: |skip_byte|, indicates that this is the final program
  step if the byte is 128 or more, otherwise the next step is obtained by
  skipping this number of intervening steps.\par
\hang second byte: |next_char|, ``if |next_char| follows the current character,
  then perform the operation and stop, otherwise continue.''\par
\hang third byte: |op_byte|, indicates a ligature step if less than~128,
  a kern step otherwise.\par
\hang fourth byte: |rem|.\par
\yskip\noindent
In a kern step, an
additional space equal to |kern[256*(op_byte-128)+rem]| is inserted
between the current character and |next_char|. This amount is
often negative, so that the characters are brought closer together
by kerning; but it might be positive.

There are eight kinds of ligature steps, having |op_byte| codes $4a+2b+c$ where
$0\le a\le b+c$ and $0\le b,c\le1$. The character whose code is
|rem| is inserted between the current character and |next_char|;
then the current character is deleted if $b=0$, and |next_char| is
deleted if $c=0$; then we pass over $a$~characters to reach the next
current character (which may have a ligature/kerning program of its own).

If the very first instruction of the |lig_kern| array has |skip_byte==255|,
the |next_char| byte is the so-called right boundary character of this font;
the value of |next_char| need not lie between |bc| and~|ec|.
If the very last instruction of the |lig_kern| array has |skip_byte==255|,
there is a special ligature/kerning program for a left boundary character,
beginning at location |256*op_byte+rem|.
The interpretation is that \TeX\ puts implicit boundary characters
before and after each consecutive string of characters from the same font.
These implicit characters do not appear in the output, but they can affect
ligatures and kerning.

If the very first instruction of a character's |lig_kern| program has
|skip_byte > 128|, the program actually begins in location
|256*op_byte+rem|. This feature allows access to large |lig_kern|
arrays, because the first instruction must otherwise
appear in a location | <= 255|.

Any instruction with |skip_byte > 128| in the |lig_kern| array must satisfy
the condition
$$\hbox{|256*op_byte+rem < nl|.}$$
If such an instruction is encountered during
normal program execution, it denotes an unconditional halt; no ligature
or kerning command is performed.

@ Extensible characters are specified by an |@!extensible_recipe|, which
consists of four bytes called |@!top|, |@!mid|, |@!bot|, and |@!rep| (in this
order). These bytes are the character codes of individual pieces used to
build up a large symbol.  If |top|, |mid|, or |bot| are zero, they are not
present in the built-up result. For example, an extensible vertical line is
like an extensible bracket, except that the top and bottom pieces are missing.

Let $T$, $M$, $B$, and $R$ denote the respective pieces, or an empty box
if the piece isn't present. Then the extensible characters have the form
$TR^kMR^kB$ from top to bottom, for some |k >= 0|, unless $M$ is absent;
in the latter case we can have $TR^kB$ for both even and odd values of~|k|.
The width of the extensible character is the width of $R$; and the
height-plus-depth is the sum of the individual height-plus-depths of the
components used, since the pieces are butted together in a vertical list.

@ The final portion of a \.{TFM} file is the |param| array, which is another
sequence of |fix_word| values.

\yskip\hang|param[1]==slant| is the amount of italic slant, which is used
to help position accents. For example, |slant==.25| means that when you go
up one unit, you also go .25 units to the right. The |slant| is a pure
number; it's the only |fix_word| other than the design size itself that is
not scaled by the design size.

\hang|param[2]==space| is the normal spacing between words in text.
Note that character |' '| in the font need not have anything to do with
blank spaces.

\hang|param[3]==space_stretch| is the amount of glue stretching between words.

\hang|param[4]==space_shrink| is the amount of glue shrinking between words.

\hang|param[5]==x_height| is the size of one ex in the font; it is also
the height of letters for which accents don't have to be raised or lowered.

\hang|param[6]==quad| is the size of one em in the font.

\hang|param[7]==extra_space| is the amount added to |param[2]| at the
ends of sentences.

\yskip\noindent
If fewer than seven parameters are present, \TeX\ sets the missing parameters
to zero. Fonts used for math symbols are required to have
additional parameter information, which is explained later.

@ So that is what \.{TFM} files hold. Since \TeX\ has to absorb such information
about lots of fonts, it stores most of the data in a large array called
|font_info|. Each item of |font_info| is a |memory_word|; the |fix_word|
data gets converted into |scaled| entries, while everything else goes into
words of type |four_quarters|.

When the user defines \.{\\font\\f}, say, \TeX\ assigns an internal number
to the user's font~\.{\\f}. Adding this number to |font_id_base| gives the
|eqtb| location of a ``frozen'' control sequence that will always select
the font.

@ Of course we want to define macros that suppress the detail of how font
information is actually packed, so that we don't have to write things like
$$\hbox{|font_info[width_base[f]+font_info[char_base[f]+c].qqqq.b0].sc|}$$
too often. The \.{WEB} definitions here make |char_info(f)(c)| the
|four_quarters| word of font information corresponding to character
|c| of font |f|. If |q| is such a word, |char_width(f)(q)| will be
the character's width; hence the long formula above is at least
abbreviated to
$$\hbox{|char_width(f)(char_info(f)(c))|.}$$
Usually, of course, we will fetch |q| first and look at several of its
fields at the same time.

The italic correction of a character will be denoted by
|char_italic(f)(q)|, so it is analogous to |char_width|.  But we will get
at the height and depth in a slightly different way, since we usually want
to compute both height and depth if we want either one.  The value of
|height_depth(q)| will be the 8-bit quantity
$$b=|height_index|\times16+|depth_index|,$$ and if |b| is such a byte we
will write |char_height(f)(b)| and |char_depth(f)(b)| for the height and
depth of the character |c| for which |q==char_info(f)(c)|. Got that?

The tag field will be called |char_tag(q)|; the remainder byte will be
called |rem_byte(q)|, using a macro that we have already defined above.

Access to a character's |width|, |height|, |depth|, and |tag| fields is
part of \TeX's inner loop, so we want these macros to produce code that is
as fast as possible under the circumstances.

@ \TeX\ checks the information of a \.{TFM} file for validity as the
file is being read in, so that no further checks will be needed when
typesetting is going on. The somewhat tedious subroutine that does this
is called |read_font_info|. It has four parameters: the user font
identifier~|u|, the file name and area strings |nom| and |aire|, and the
``at'' size~|s|. If |s|~is negative, it's the negative of a scale factor
to be applied to the design size; |s==-1000| is the normal case.
Otherwise |s| will be substituted for the design size; in this
case, |s| must be positive and less than $2048\rm\,pt$
(i.e., it must be less than $2^{27}$ when considered as an integer).

The subroutine opens and closes a global file variable called |tfm_file|.
It returns the value of the internal font number that was just loaded.
If an error is detected, an error message is issued and no font
information is stored; |null_font| is returned in this case.

(No other choices of |a| are allowed, since the magnitude of a number in
design-size units must be less than 16.)  We want to multiply this
quantity by the integer~|z|, which is known to be less than $2^{27}$.
If $|z|<2^{23}$, the individual multiplications $b\cdot z$,
$c\cdot z$, $d\cdot z$ cannot overflow; otherwise we will divide |z| by 2,
4, 8, or 16, to obtain a multiplier less than $2^{23}$, and we can
compensate for this later. If |z| has thereby been replaced by
$|z|^\prime=|z|/2^e$, let $\beta=2^{4-e}$; we shall compute
$$\lfloor(b+c\cdot2^{-8}+d\cdot2^{-16})\,z^\prime/\beta\rfloor$$
if $a=0$, or the same quantity minus $\alpha=2^{4+e}z^\prime$ if $a=255$.
This calculation must be done exactly, in order to guarantee portability
of \TeX\ between computers.

@* Device-independent file format.
The most important output produced by a run of \TeX\ is the ``device
independent'' (\.{DVI}) file that specifies where characters and rules
are to appear on printed pages. The form of these files was designed by
David R. Fuchs in 1979. Almost any reasonable typesetting device can be
@^Fuchs, David Raymond@>
@:DVI_files}{\.{DVI} files@>
driven by a program that takes \.{DVI} files as input, and dozens of such
\.{DVI}-to-whatever programs have been written. Thus, it is possible to
print the output of \TeX\ on many different kinds of equipment, using \TeX\
as a device-independent ``front end.''

A \.{DVI} file is a stream of 8-bit bytes, which may be regarded as a
series of commands in a machine-like language. The first byte of each command
is the operation code, and this code is followed by zero or more bytes
that provide parameters to the command. The parameters themselves may consist
of several consecutive bytes; for example, the `|set_rule|' command has two
parameters, each of which is four bytes long. Parameters are usually
regarded as nonnegative integers; but four-byte-long parameters,
and shorter parameters that denote distances, can be
either positive or negative. Such parameters are given in two's complement
notation. For example, a two-byte-long distance parameter has a value between
$-2^{15}$ and $2^{15}-1$. As in \.{TFM} files, numbers that occupy
more than one byte position appear in BigEndian order.

A \.{DVI} file consists of a ``preamble,'' followed by a sequence of one
or more ``pages,'' followed by a ``postamble.'' The preamble is simply a
|pre| command, with its parameters that define the dimensions used in the
file; this must come first.  Each ``page'' consists of a |bop| command,
followed by any number of other commands that tell where characters are to
be placed on a physical page, followed by an |eop| command. The pages
appear in the order that \TeX\ generated them. If we ignore |nop| commands
and \\{fnt\_def} commands (which are allowed between any two commands in
the file), each |eop| command is immediately followed by a |bop| command,
or by a |post| command; in the latter case, there are no more pages in the
file, and the remaining bytes form the postamble.  Further details about
the postamble will be explained later.

Some parameters in \.{DVI} commands are ``pointers.'' These are four-byte
quantities that give the location number of some other byte in the file;
the first byte is number~0, then comes number~1, and so on. For example,
one of the parameters of a |bop| command points to the previous |bop|;
this makes it feasible to read the pages in backwards order, in case the
results are being directed to a device that stacks its output face up.
Suppose the preamble of a \.{DVI} file occupies bytes 0 to 99. Now if the
first page occupies bytes 100 to 999, say, and if the second
page occupies bytes 1000 to 1999, then the |bop| that starts in byte 1000
points to 100 and the |bop| that starts in byte 2000 points to 1000. (The
very first |bop|, i.e., the one starting in byte 100, has a pointer of~$-1$.)

@ The \.{DVI} format is intended to be both compact and easily interpreted
by a machine. Compactness is achieved by making most of the information
implicit instead of explicit. When a \.{DVI}-reading program reads the
commands for a page, it keeps track of several quantities: (a)~The current
font |f| is an integer; this value is changed only
by \\{fnt} and \\{fnt\_num} commands. (b)~The current position on the page
is given by two numbers called the horizontal and vertical coordinates,
|h| and |v|. Both coordinates are zero at the upper left corner of the page;
moving to the right corresponds to increasing the horizontal coordinate, and
moving down corresponds to increasing the vertical coordinate. Thus, the
coordinates are essentially Cartesian, except that vertical directions are
flipped; the Cartesian version of |(h, v)| would be |(h,-v)|.  (c)~The
current spacing amounts are given by four numbers |w|, |x|, |y|, and |z|,
where |w| and~|x| are used for horizontal spacing and where |y| and~|z|
are used for vertical spacing. (d)~There is a stack containing
|(h, v, w, x, y, z)| values; the \.{DVI} commands |push| and |pop| are used to
change the current level of operation. Note that the current font~|f| is
not pushed and popped; the stack contains only information about
positioning.

The values of |h|, |v|, |w|, |x|, |y|, and |z| are signed integers having up
to 32 bits, including the sign. Since they represent physical distances,
there is a small unit of measurement such that increasing |h| by~1 means
moving a certain tiny distance to the right. The actual unit of
measurement is variable, as explained below; \TeX\ sets things up so that
its \.{DVI} output is in sp units, i.e., scaled points, in agreement with
all the |scaled| dimensions in \TeX's data structures.

@ Here is a list of all the commands that may appear in a \.{DVI} file. Each
command is specified by its symbolic name (e.g., |bop|), its opcode byte
(e.g., 139), and its parameters (if any). The parameters are followed
by a bracketed number telling how many bytes they occupy; for example,
`|p[4]|' means that parameter |p| is four bytes long.

\yskip\hang|set_char_0| 0. Typeset character number~0 from font~|f|
such that the reference point of the character is at |(h, v)|. Then
increase |h| by the width of that character. Note that a character may
have zero or negative width, so one cannot be sure that |h| will advance
after this command; but |h| usually does increase.

\yskip\hang\\{set\_char\_1} through \\{set\_char\_127} (opcodes 1 to 127).
Do the operations of |set_char_0|; but use the character whose number
matches the opcode, instead of character~0.

\yskip\hang|set1| 128 |c[1]|. Same as |set_char_0|, except that character
number~|c| is typeset. \TeX82 uses this command for characters in the
range |128 <= c < 256|.

\yskip\hang|@!set2| 129 |c[2]|. Same as |set1|, except that |c|~is two
bytes long, so it is in the range |0 <= c < 65536|. \TeX82 never uses this
command, but it should come in handy for extensions of \TeX\ that deal
with oriental languages.
@^oriental characters@>@^Chinese characters@>@^Japanese characters@>

\yskip\hang|@!set3| 130 |c[3]|. Same as |set1|, except that |c|~is three
bytes long, so it can be as large as $2^{24}-1$. Not even the Chinese
language has this many characters, but this command might prove useful
in some yet unforeseen extension.

\yskip\hang|@!set4| 131 |c[4]|. Same as |set1|, except that |c|~is four
bytes long. Imagine that.

\yskip\hang|set_rule| 132 |a[4]| |b[4]|. Typeset a solid black rectangle
of height~|a| and width~|b|, with its bottom left corner at |(h, v)|. Then
set |h=h+b|. If either |a <= 0| or |b <= 0|, nothing should be typeset. Note
that if |b < 0|, the value of |h| will decrease even though nothing else happens.
See below for details about how to typeset rules so that consistency with
\MF\ is guaranteed.

\yskip\hang|@!put1| 133 |c[1]|. Typeset character number~|c| from font~|f|
such that the reference point of the character is at |(h, v)|. (The `put'
commands are exactly like the `set' commands, except that they simply put out a
character or a rule without moving the reference point afterwards.)

\yskip\hang|@!put2| 134 |c[2]|. Same as |set2|, except that |h| is not changed.

\yskip\hang|@!put3| 135 |c[3]|. Same as |set3|, except that |h| is not changed.

\yskip\hang|@!put4| 136 |c[4]|. Same as |set4|, except that |h| is not changed.

\yskip\hang|put_rule| 137 |a[4]| |b[4]|. Same as |set_rule|, except that
|h| is not changed.

\yskip\hang|nop| 138. No operation, do nothing. Any number of |nop|'s
may occur between \.{DVI} commands, but a |nop| cannot be inserted between
a command and its parameters or between two parameters.

\yskip\hang|bop| 139 $c_0[4]$ $c_1[4]$ $\ldots$ $c_9[4]$ $p[4]$. Beginning
of a page: Set |(h, v, w, x, y, z)=(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)| and set the stack empty. Set
the current font |f| to an undefined value.  The ten $c_i$ parameters hold
the values of \.{\\count0} $\ldots$ \.{\\count9} in \TeX\ at the time
\.{\\shipout} was invoked for this page; they can be used to identify
pages, if a user wants to print only part of a \.{DVI} file. The parameter
|p| points to the previous |bop| in the file; the first
|bop| has $p=-1$.

\yskip\hang|eop| 140.  End of page: Print what you have read since the
previous |bop|. At this point the stack should be empty. (The \.{DVI}-reading
programs that drive most output devices will have kept a buffer of the
material that appears on the page that has just ended. This material is
largely, but not entirely, in order by |v| coordinate and (for fixed |v|) by
|h|~coordinate; so it usually needs to be sorted into some order that is
appropriate for the device in question.)

\yskip\hang|push| 141. Push the current values of |(h, v, w, x, y, z)| onto the
top of the stack; do not change any of these values. Note that |f| is
not pushed.

\yskip\hang|pop| 142. Pop the top six values off of the stack and assign
them respectively to |(h, v, w, x, y, z)|. The number of pops should never
exceed the number of pushes, since it would be highly embarrassing if the
stack were empty at the time of a |pop| command.

\yskip\hang|right1| 143 |b[1]|. Set |h=h+b|, i.e., move right |b| units.
The parameter is a signed number in two's complement notation, |-128 <= b < 128|;
if |b < 0|, the reference point moves left.

\yskip\hang|right2| 144 |b[2]|. Same as |right1|, except that |b| is a
two-byte quantity in the range |-32768 <= b < 32768|.

\yskip\hang|right3| 145 |b[3]|. Same as |right1|, except that |b| is a
three-byte quantity in the range |@t$-2^{23}$@> <= b < @t$2^{23}$@>|.

\yskip\hang|right4| 146 |b[4]|. Same as |right1|, except that |b| is a
four-byte quantity in the range |@t$-2^{31}$@> <= b < @t$2^{31}$@>|.

\yskip\hang|w0| 147. Set |h=h+w|; i.e., move right |w| units. With luck,
this parameterless command will usually suffice, because the same kind of motion
will occur several times in succession; the following commands explain how
|w| gets particular values.

\yskip\hang|w1| 148 |b[1]|. Set |w=b| and |h=h+b|. The value of |b| is a
signed quantity in two's complement notation, |-128 <= b < 128|. This command
changes the current |w|~spacing and moves right by |b|.

\yskip\hang|@!w2| 149 |b[2]|. Same as |w1|, but |b| is two bytes long,
|-32768 <= b < 32768|.

\yskip\hang|@!w3| 150 |b[3]|. Same as |w1|, but |b| is three bytes long,
|@t$-2^{23}$@> <= b < @t$2^{23}$@>|.

\yskip\hang|@!w4| 151 |b[4]|. Same as |w1|, but |b| is four bytes long,
|@t$-2^{31}$@> <= b < @t$2^{31}$@>|.

\yskip\hang|x0| 152. Set |h=h+x|; i.e., move right |x| units. The `|x|'
commands are like the `|w|' commands except that they involve |x| instead
of |w|.

\yskip\hang|x1| 153 |b[1]|. Set |x=b| and |h=h+b|. The value of |b| is a
signed quantity in two's complement notation, |-128 <= b < 128|. This command
changes the current |x|~spacing and moves right by |b|.

\yskip\hang|@!x2| 154 |b[2]|. Same as |x1|, but |b| is two bytes long,
|-32768 <= b < 32768|.

\yskip\hang|@!x3| 155 |b[3]|. Same as |x1|, but |b| is three bytes long,
|@t$-2^{23}$@> <= b < @t$2^{23}$@>|.

\yskip\hang|@!x4| 156 |b[4]|. Same as |x1|, but |b| is four bytes long,
|@t$-2^{31}$@> <= b < @t$2^{31}$@>|.

\yskip\hang|down1| 157 |a[1]|. Set |v=v+a|, i.e., move down |a| units.
The parameter is a signed number in two's complement notation, |-128 <= a < 128|;
if |a < 0|, the reference point moves up.

\yskip\hang|@!down2| 158 |a[2]|. Same as |down1|, except that |a| is a
two-byte quantity in the range |-32768 <= a < 32768|.

\yskip\hang|@!down3| 159 |a[3]|. Same as |down1|, except that |a| is a
three-byte quantity in the range |@t$-2^{23}$@> <= a < @t$2^{23}$@>|.

\yskip\hang|@!down4| 160 |a[4]|. Same as |down1|, except that |a| is a
four-byte quantity in the range |@t$-2^{31}$@> <= a < @t$2^{31}$@>|.

\yskip\hang|y0| 161. Set |v=v+y|; i.e., move down |y| units. With luck,
this parameterless command will usually suffice, because the same kind of motion
will occur several times in succession; the following commands explain how
|y| gets particular values.

\yskip\hang|y1| 162 |a[1]|. Set |y=a| and |v=v+a|. The value of |a| is a
signed quantity in two's complement notation, |-128 <= a < 128|. This command
changes the current |y|~spacing and moves down by |a|.

\yskip\hang|@!y2| 163 |a[2]|. Same as |y1|, but |a| is two bytes long,
|-32768 <= a < 32768|.

\yskip\hang|@!y3| 164 |a[3]|. Same as |y1|, but |a| is three bytes long,

\yskip\hang|@!y4| 165 |a[4]|. Same as |y1|, but |a| is four bytes long,
|@t$-2^{31}$@> <= a < @t$2^{31}$@>|.

\yskip\hang|z0| 166. Set |v=v+z|; i.e., move down |z| units. The `|z|' commands
are like the `|y|' commands except that they involve |z| instead of |y|.

\yskip\hang|z1| 167 |a[1]|. Set |z=a| and |v=v+a|. The value of |a| is a

changes the current |z|~spacing and moves down by |a|.

\yskip\hang|@!z2| 168 |a[2]|. Same as |z1|, but |a| is two bytes long,

@ The preamble contains basic information about the file as a whole. As
stated above, there are six parameters:
$$\hbox{|@!i[1]| |@!num[4]| |@!den[4]| |@!mag[4]| |@!k[1]| |@!x[k]|.}$$
The |i| byte identifies \.{DVI} format; currently this byte is always set
to~2. (The value |i==3| is currently used for an extended format that
allows a mixture of right-to-left and left-to-right typesetting.
Some day we will set |i==4|, when \.{DVI} format makes another
incompatible change---perhaps in the year 2048.)

The next two parameters, |num| and |den|, are positive integers that define
the units of measurement; they are the numerator and denominator of a
fraction by which all dimensions in the \.{DVI} file could be multiplied
in order to get lengths in units of $10^{-7}$ meters. Since $\rm 7227{pt} =
254{cm}$, and since \TeX\ works with scaled points where there are $2^{16}$
sp in a point, \TeX\ sets
$|num|/|den|=(254\cdot10^5)/(7227\cdot2^{16})=25400000/473628672$.
@^sp@>

The |mag| parameter is what \TeX\ calls \.{\\mag}, i.e., 1000 times the
desired magnification. The actual fraction by which dimensions are
multiplied is therefore $|mag|\cdot|num|/1000|den|$. Note that if a \TeX\
source document does not call for any `\.{true}' dimensions, and if you
change it only by specifying a different \.{\\mag} setting, the \.{DVI}
file that \TeX\ creates will be completely unchanged except for the value
of |mag| in the preamble and postamble. (Fancy \.{DVI}-reading programs allow
users to override the |mag|~setting when a \.{DVI} file is being printed.)

Finally, |k| and |x| allow the \.{DVI} writer to include a comment, which is not
interpreted further. The length of comment |x| is |k|, where |0 <= k < 256|.

@d id_byte	2 /*identifies the kind of \.{DVI} files described here*/ 

@ Font definitions for a given font number |k| contain further parameters
$$\hbox{|c[4]| |s[4]| |d[4]| |a[1]| |l[1]| |n[a+l]|.}$$
The four-byte value |c| is the check sum that \TeX\ found in the \.{TFM}
file for this font; |c| should match the check sum of the font found by
programs that read this \.{DVI} file.
@^check sum@>

Parameter |s| contains a fixed-point scale factor that is applied to
the character widths in font |k|; font dimensions in \.{TFM} files and
other font files are relative to this quantity, which is called the
``at size'' elsewhere in this documentation. The value of |s| is
always positive and less than $2^{27}$. It is given in the same units
as the other \.{DVI} dimensions, i.e., in sp when \TeX82 has made the
file.  Parameter |d| is similar to |s|; it is the ``design size,'' and
(like~|s|) it is given in \.{DVI} units. Thus, font |k| is to be used
at $|mag|\cdot s/1000d$ times its normal size.

The remaining part of a font definition gives the external name of the font,
which is an ASCII string of length |a+l|. The number |a| is the length
of the ``area'' or directory, and |l| is the length of the font name itself;
the standard local system font area is supposed to be used when |a==0|.
The |n| field contains the area in its first |a| bytes.

Font definitions must appear before the first use of a particular font number.
Once font |k| is defined, it must not be defined again; however, we
shall see below that font definitions appear in the postamble as well as
in the pages, so in this sense each font number is defined exactly twice,
if at all. Like |nop| commands, font definitions can
appear before the first |bop|, or between an |eop| and a |bop|.

@ Sometimes it is desirable to make horizontal or vertical rules line up
precisely with certain features in characters of a font. It is possible to
guarantee the correct matching between \.{DVI} output and the characters
generated by \MF\ by adhering to the following principles: (1)~The \MF\
characters should be positioned so that a bottom edge or left edge that is
supposed to line up with the bottom or left edge of a rule appears at the
reference point, i.e., in row~0 and column~0 of the \MF\ raster. This
ensures that the position of the rule will not be rounded differently when
the pixel size is not a perfect multiple of the units of measurement in
the \.{DVI} file. (2)~A typeset rule of height $a>0$ and width $b>0$
should be equivalent to a \MF-generated character having black pixels in
precisely those raster positions whose \MF\ coordinates satisfy
|0 <= x < @t$\alpha$@>b| and |0 <= y < @t$\alpha$@>a|, where $\alpha$ is the number
of pixels per \.{DVI} unit.

@^rules aligning with characters@>

@ The last page in a \.{DVI} file is followed by `|post|'; this command
introduces the postamble, which summarizes important facts that \TeX\ has
accumulated about the file, making it possible to print subsets of the data
with reasonable efficiency. The postamble has the form
$$\vbox{\halign{\hbox{#\hfil}\cr
  |post| |p[4]| |num[4]| |den[4]| |mag[4]| |l[4]| |u[4]| |s[2]| |t[2]|\cr
  $\langle\,$font definitions$\,\rangle$\cr
  |post_post| |q[4]| |i[1]| 223's$[{\G}4]$\cr}}$$
Here |p| is a pointer to the final |bop| in the file. The next three
parameters, |num|, |den|, and |mag|, are duplicates of the quantities that
appeared in the preamble.

Parameters |l| and |u| give respectively the height-plus-depth of the tallest
page and the width of the widest page, in the same units as other dimensions
of the file. These numbers might be used by a \.{DVI}-reading program to
position individual ``pages'' on large sheets of film or paper; however,
the standard convention for output on normal size paper is to position each
page so that the upper left-hand corner is exactly one inch from the left
and the top. Experience has shown that it is unwise to design \.{DVI}-to-printer
software that attempts cleverly to center the output; a fixed position of
the upper left corner is easiest for users to understand and to work with.
Therefore |l| and~|u| are often ignored.

Parameter |s| is the maximum stack depth (i.e., the largest excess of
|push| commands over |pop| commands) needed to process this file. Then
comes |t|, the total number of pages (|bop| commands) present.

The postamble continues with font definitions, which are any number of
\\{fnt\_def} commands as described above, possibly interspersed with |nop|
commands. Each font number that is used in the \.{DVI} file must be defined
exactly twice: Once before it is first selected by a \\{fnt} command, and once
in the postamble.

@ The last part of the postamble, following the |post_post| byte that
signifies the end of the font definitions, contains |q|, a pointer to the
|post| command that started the postamble.  An identification byte, |i|,
comes next; this currently equals~2, as in the preamble.

The |i| byte is followed by four or more bytes that are all equal to
the decimal number 223 (i.e., 0337 in octal). \TeX\ puts out four to seven of
these trailing bytes, until the total length of the file is a multiple of
four bytes, since this works out best on machines that pack four bytes per
word; but any number of 223's is allowed, as long as there are at least four
of them. In effect, 223 is a sort of signature that is added at the very end.
@^Fuchs, David Raymond@>

This curious way to finish off a \.{DVI} file makes it feasible for
\.{DVI}-reading programs to find the postamble first, on most computers,
even though \TeX\ wants to write the postamble last. Most operating
systems permit random access to individual words or bytes of a file, so
the \.{DVI} reader can start at the end and skip backwards over the 223's
until finding the identification byte. Then it can back up four bytes, read
|q|, and move to byte |q| of the file. This byte should, of course,
contain the value 248 (|post|); now the postamble can be read, so the
\.{DVI} reader can discover all the information needed for typesetting the
pages. Note that it is also possible to skip through the \.{DVI} file at
reasonably high speed to locate a particular page, if that proves
desirable. This saves a lot of time, since \.{DVI} files used in production
jobs tend to be large.

Unfortunately, however, standard \PASCAL\ does not include the ability to
@^system dependencies@>
access a random position in a file, or even to determine the length of a file.
Almost all systems nowadays provide the necessary capabilities, so \.{DVI}
format has been designed to work most efficiently with modern operating systems.
But if \.{DVI} files have to be processed under the restrictions of standard
\PASCAL, one can simply read them from front to back, since the necessary
header information is present in the preamble and in the font definitions.
(The |l| and |u| and |s| and |t| parameters, which appear only in the
postamble, are ``frills'' that are handy but not absolutely necessary.)

@* Shipping pages out.
After considering \TeX's eyes and stomach, we come now to the bowels.
@^bowels@>

The |ship_out| procedure is given a pointer to a box; its mission is
to describe that box in \.{DVI} form, outputting a ``page'' to |dvi_file|.
The \.{DVI} coordinates $(h,v)=(0,0)$ should correspond to the upper left
corner of the box being shipped.

Since boxes can be inside of boxes inside of boxes, the main work of
|ship_out| is done by two mutually recursive routines, |hlist_out|
and |vlist_out|, which traverse the hlists and vlists inside of horizontal
and vertical boxes.

As individual pages are being processed, we need to accumulate
information about the entire set of pages, since such statistics must be
reported in the postamble. The global variables |total_pages|, |max_v|,
|max_h|, |max_push|, and |last_bop| are used to record this information.

The variable |doing_leaders| is |true| while leaders are being output.
The variable |dead_cycles| contains the number of times an output routine
has been initiated since the last |ship_out|.

A few additional global variables are also defined here for use in
|vlist_out| and |hlist_out|. They could have been local variables, but
that would waste stack space when boxes are deeply nested, since the
values of these variables are not needed during recursive calls.

@ The \.{DVI} bytes are output to a buffer instead of being written directly
to the output file. This makes it possible to reduce the overhead of
subroutine calls, thereby measurably speeding up the computation, since
output of \.{DVI} bytes is part of \TeX's inner loop. And it has another
advantage as well, since we can change instructions in the buffer in order to
make the output more compact. For example, a `|down2|' command can be
changed to a `|y2|', thereby making a subsequent `|y0|' command possible,
saving two bytes.

The output buffer is divided into two parts of equal size; the bytes found
in |dvi_buf[0 dotdot half_buf-1]| constitute the first half, and those in
|dvi_buf[half_buf dotdot dvi_buf_size-1]| constitute the second. The global
variable |dvi_ptr| points to the position that will receive the next
output byte. When |dvi_ptr| reaches |dvi_limit|, which is always equal
to one of the two values |half_buf| or |dvi_buf_size|, the half buffer that
is about to be invaded next is sent to the output and |dvi_limit| is
changed to its other value. Thus, there is always at least a half buffer's
worth of information present, except at the very beginning of the job.

Bytes of the \.{DVI} file are numbered sequentially starting with 0;
the next byte to be generated will be number |dvi_offset+dvi_ptr|.
A byte is present in the buffer only if its number is | >= dvi_gone|.

\TeX's inner loop. It is safe to assume that |a| and |b+1| will both be
multiples of 4 when |write_dvi(a, b)| is called; therefore it is possible on
many machines to use efficient methods to pack four bytes per word and to

@ Versions of \TeX\ intended for small computers might well choose to omit
the ideas in the next few parts of this program, since it is not really
necessary to optimize the \.{DVI} code by making use of the |w0|, |x0|,
|y0|, and |z0| commands. Furthermore, the algorithm that we are about to
describe does not pretend to give an optimum reduction in the length
of the \.{DVI} code; after all, speed is more important than compactness.
But the method is surprisingly effective, and it takes comparatively little
time.

We can best understand the basic idea by first considering a simpler problem
that has the same essential characteristics. Given a sequence of digits,
say $3\,1\,4\,1\,5\,9\,2\,6\,5\,3\,5\,8\,9$, we want to assign subscripts
$d$, $y$, or $z$ to each digit so as to maximize the number of ``$y$-hits''
and ``$z$-hits''; a $y$-hit is an instance of two appearances of the same
digit with the subscript $y$, where no $y$'s intervene between the two
appearances, and a $z$-hit is defined similarly. For example, the sequence
above could be decorated with subscripts as follows:
$$3_z\,1_y\,4_d\,1_y\,5_y\,9_d\,2_d\,6_d\,5_y\,3_z\,5_y\,8_d\,9_d.$$
There are three $y$-hits ($1_y\ldots1_y$ and $5_y\ldots5_y\ldots5_y$) and
one $z$-hit ($3_z\ldots3_z$); there are no $d$-hits, since the two appearances
of $9_d$ have $d$'s between them, but we don't count $d$-hits so it doesn't
matter how many there are. These subscripts are analogous to the \.{DVI}
commands called \\{down}, $y$, and $z$, and the digits are analogous to
different amounts of vertical motion; a $y$-hit or $z$-hit corresponds to
the opportunity to use the one-byte commands |y0| or |z0| in a \.{DVI} file.

\TeX's method of assigning subscripts works like this: Append a new digit,
say $\delta$, to the right of the sequence. Now look back through the
sequence until one of the following things happens: (a)~You see
$\delta_y$ or $\delta_z$, and this was the first time you encountered a
$y$ or $z$ subscript, respectively.  Then assign $y$ or $z$ to the new
$\delta$; you have scored a hit. (b)~You see $\delta_d$, and no $y$
subscripts have been encountered so far during this search.  Then change
the previous $\delta_d$ to $\delta_y$ (this corresponds to changing a
command in the output buffer), and assign $y$ to the new $\delta$; it's
another hit.  (c)~You see $\delta_d$, and a $y$ subscript has been seen
but not a $z$.  Change the previous $\delta_d$ to $\delta_z$ and assign
$z$ to the new $\delta$. (d)~You encounter both $y$ and $z$ subscripts
before encountering a suitable $\delta$, or you scan all the way to the
front of the sequence. Assign $d$ to the new $\delta$; this assignment may
be changed later.

The subscripts $3_z\,1_y\,4_d\ldots\,$ in the example above were, in fact,
produced by this procedure, as the reader can verify. (Go ahead and try it.)

@ In order to implement such an idea, \TeX\ maintains a stack of pointers
to the \\{down}, $y$, and $z$ commands that have been generated for the
current page. And there is a similar stack for \\{right}, |w|, and |x|
commands. These stacks are called the down stack and right stack, and their
top elements are maintained in the variables |down_ptr| and |right_ptr|.

Each entry in these stacks contains four fields: The |width| field is
the amount of motion down or to the right; the |location| field is the
byte number of the \.{DVI} command in question (including the appropriate
|dvi_offset|); the |link| field points to the next item below this one
on the stack; and the |info| field encodes the options for possible change
in the \.{DVI} command.

of motion, and |o| is either |down1| or |right1|. We use the fact that
the command codes have convenient arithmetic properties: |y1-down1==w1-right1|
and |z1-down1==x1-right1|.

@p void movement(scaled @!w, eight_bits @!o)

q=get_node(movement_node_size); /*new node for the top of the stack*/

@<Generate a |down| or |right| command for |w| and |return|@>;
found: @<Generate a |y0| or |z0| command in order to reuse a previous appearance of~|w|@>;
} 

@ The |info| fields in the entries of the down stack or the right stack
have six possible settings: |y_here| or |z_here| mean that the \.{DVI}
command refers to |y| or |z|, respectively (or to |w| or |x|, in the
case of horizontal motion); |yz_OK| means that the \.{DVI} command is
\\{down} (or \\{right}) but can be changed to either |y| or |z| (or
to either |w| or |x|); |y_OK| means that it is \\{down} and can be changed
to |y| but not |z|; |z_OK| is similar; and |d_fixed| means it must stay
\\{down}.

The four settings |yz_OK|, |y_OK|, |z_OK|, |d_fixed| would not need to
be distinguished from each other if we were simply solving the
digit-subscripting problem mentioned above. But in \TeX's case there is
a complication because of the nested structure of |push| and |pop|
commands. Suppose we add parentheses to the digit-subscripting problem,
redefining hits so that $\delta_y\ldots \delta_y$ is a hit if all $y$'s between
the $\delta$'s are enclosed in properly nested parentheses, and if the
parenthesis level of the right-hand $\delta_y$ is deeper than or equal to
that of the left-hand one. Thus, `(' and `)' correspond to `|push|'
and `|pop|'. Now if we want to assign a subscript to the final 1 in the
sequence
$$2_y\,7_d\,1_d\,(\,8_z\,2_y\,8_z\,)\,1$$
we cannot change the previous $1_d$ to $1_y$, since that would invalidate
the $2_y\ldots2_y$ hit. But we can change it to $1_z$, scoring a hit
since the intervening $8_z$'s are enclosed in parentheses.

The program below removes movement nodes that are introduced after a |push|,
before it outputs the corresponding |pop|.

@d z_here	2 /*|info| when the movement entry points to a |z| command*/

@d d_fixed	6 /*|info| corresponding to a \\{down} that can't change*/ 

@ When the |movement| procedure gets to the label |found|, the value of
|info(p)| will be either |y_here| or |z_here|. If it is, say, |y_here|,
the procedure generates a |y0| command (or a |w0| command), and marks
all |info| fields between |q| and |p| so that |y| is not OK in that range.

@ In case you are wondering when all the movement nodes are removed from
\TeX's memory, the answer is that they are recycled just before
|hlist_out| and |vlist_out| finish outputting a box. This restores the
down and right stacks to the state they were in before the box was output,
except that some |info|'s may have become more restrictive.

@ The actual distances by which we want to move might be computed as the
sum of several separate movements. For example, there might be several
glue nodes in succession, or we might want to move right by the width of
some box plus some amount of glue. More importantly, the baselineskip
distances are computed in terms of glue together with the depth and
height of adjacent boxes, and we want the \.{DVI} file to lump these
three quantities together into a single motion.

Therefore, \TeX\ maintains two pairs of global variables: |dvi_h| and |dvi_v|
are the |h| and |v| coordinates corresponding to the commands actually
output to the \.{DVI} file, while |cur_h| and |cur_v| are the coordinates
corresponding to the current state of the output routines. Coordinate
changes will accumulate in |cur_h| and |cur_v| without being reflected
in the output, until such a change becomes necessary or desirable; we
can call the |movement| procedure whenever we want to make |dvi_h==cur_h|
or |dvi_v==cur_v|.

The current font reflected in the \.{DVI} output is called |dvi_f|;
there is no need for a `\\{cur\_f}' variable.

The depth of nesting of |hlist_out| and |vlist_out| is called |cur_s|;
this is essentially the depth of |push| commands in the \.{DVI} output.

all cases even though some implementations of \PASCAL\ give nonstandard
results for the |/| operation when |cur_h| is less than |left_edge|.

by half of the excess space not occupied by the leaders; and in the
case of |x_leaders| (expanded leaders) we increase |cur_h|
by $1/(q+1)$ of this excess space, where $q$ is the number of times the
leader box will be replicated. Slight inaccuracies in the division might
accumulate; half of this rounding error is placed at each end of the leaders.

@* Packaging.
We're essentially done with the parts of \TeX\ that are concerned with
the input (|get_next|) and the output (|ship_out|). So it's time to
get heavily into the remaining part, which does the real work of typesetting.

After lists are constructed, \TeX\ wraps them up and puts them into boxes.
Two major subroutines are given the responsibility for this task: |hpack|
applies to horizontal lists (hlists) and |vpack| applies to vertical lists
(vlists). The main duty of |hpack| and |vpack| is to compute the dimensions
of the resulting boxes, and to adjust the glue if one of those dimensions
is pre-specified. The computed sizes normally enclose all of the material
inside the new box; but some items may stick out if negative glue is used,
if the box is overfull, or if a \.{\\vbox} includes other boxes that have
been shifted left.

The subroutine call |hpack(p, w, m)| returns a pointer to an |hlist_node|
for a box containing the hlist that starts at |p|. Parameter |w| specifies
a width; and parameter |m| is either `|exactly|' or `|additional|'.  Thus,
|hpack(p, w, exactly)| produces a box whose width is exactly |w|, while
|hpack(p, w, additional)| yields a box whose width is the natural width plus
|w|.  It is convenient to define a macro called `|natural|' to cover the
most common case, so that we can say |hpack(p, natural)| to get a box that
has the natural width of list |p|.

Similarly, |vpack(p, w, m)| returns a pointer to a |vlist_node| for a
box containing the vlist that starts at |p|. In this case |w| represents
a height instead of a width; the parameter |m| is interpreted as in |hpack|.

@d exactly	0 /*a box dimension is pre-specified*/ 
@d additional	1 /*a box dimension is increased from the natural one*/ 
@d natural	0, additional /*shorthand for parameters to |hpack| and |vpack|*/ 

@ The parameters to |hpack| and |vpack| correspond to \TeX's primitives
like `\.{\\hbox} \.{to} \.{300pt}', `\.{\\hbox} \.{spread} \.{10pt}'; note
that `\.{\\hbox}' with no dimension following it is equivalent to
`\.{\\hbox} \.{spread} \.{0pt}'.  The |scan_spec| subroutine scans such
constructions in the user's input, including the mandatory left brace that
follows them, and it puts the specification onto |save_stack| so that the
desired box can later be obtained by executing the following code:
$$\vbox{\halign{#\hfil\cr
|save_ptr=save_ptr-2;|\cr
|hpack(p, saved(1), saved(0)).|\cr}}$$
Special care is necessary to ensure that the special |save_stack| codes
are placed just below the new group code, because scanning can change
|save_stack| when \.{\\csname} appears.

@p void scan_spec(group_code @!c, bool @!three_codes)
   /*scans a box specification and left brace*/ 
{@+
int @!s; /*temporarily saved value*/ 
uint8_t @!spec_code;
if (three_codes) s=saved(0);
if (scan_keyword(@[@<|"to"|@>@])) spec_code=exactly;
@.to@>
else if (scan_keyword(@[@<|"spread"|@>@])) spec_code=additional;
@.spread@>
else{@+spec_code=additional;cur_val=0;
  goto found;
  } 
scan_normal_dimen;
found: if (three_codes) 
  {@+saved(0)=s;incr(save_ptr);
  } 
saved(0)=spec_code;saved(1)=cur_val;save_ptr=save_ptr+2;
new_save_level(c);scan_left_brace();
} 

@ To figure out the glue setting, |hpack| and |vpack| determine how much
stretchability and shrinkability are present, considering all four orders
of infinity. The highest order of infinity that has a nonzero coefficient
is then used as if no other orders were present.

For example, suppose that the given list contains six glue nodes with
the respective stretchabilities 3pt, 8fill, 5fil, 6pt, $-3$fil, $-8$fill.
Then the total is essentially 2fil; and if a total additional space of 6pt
is to be achieved by stretching, the actual amounts of stretch will be
0pt, 0pt, 15pt, 0pt, $-9$pt, and 0pt, since only `fil' glue will be
considered. (The `fill' glue is therefore not really stretching infinitely
with respect to `fil'; nobody would actually want that to happen.)

The arrays |total_stretch| and |total_shrink| are used to determine how much
glue of each kind is present. A global variable |last_badness| is used
to implement \.{\\badness}.

@<Glob...@>=
scaled @!total_stretch0[filll-normal+1], *const @!total_stretch = @!total_stretch0-normal, @!total_shrink0[filll-normal+1], *const @!total_shrink = @!total_shrink0-normal;
   /*glue found by |hpack| or |vpack|*/ 
int @!last_badness; /*badness of the most recently packaged box*/ 

@ If the global variable |adjust_tail| is non-null, the |hpack| routine
also removes all occurrences of |ins_node|, |mark_node|, and |adjust_node|
items and appends the resulting material onto the list that ends at
location |adjust_tail|.

computed by the normal rules; if it exceeds this limit, the reference

@* Data structures for math mode.
When \TeX\ reads a formula that is enclosed between \.\$'s, it constructs an
{\sl mlist}, which is essentially a tree structure representing that
formula.  An mlist is a linear sequence of items, but we can regard it as
a tree structure because mlists can appear within mlists. For example, many
of the entries can be subscripted or superscripted, and such ``scripts''
are mlists in their own right.

An entire formula is parsed into such a tree before any of the actual
typesetting is done, because the current style of type is usually not
known until the formula has been fully scanned. For example, when the
formula `\.{\$a+b \\over c+d\$}' is being read, there is no way to tell
that `\.{a+b}' will be in script size until `\.{\\over}' has appeared.

During the scanning process, each element of the mlist being built is
classified as a relation, a binary operator, an open parenthesis, etc.,
or as a construct like `\.{\\sqrt}' that must be built up. This classification
appears in the mlist data structure.

After a formula has been fully scanned, the mlist is converted to an hlist
so that it can be incorporated into the surrounding text. This conversion is
controlled by a recursive procedure that decides all of the appropriate
styles by a ``top-down'' process starting at the outermost level and working
in towards the subformulas. The formula is ultimately pasted together using
combinations of horizontal and vertical boxes, with glue and penalty nodes
inserted as necessary.

An mlist is represented internally as a linked list consisting chiefly
of ``noads'' (pronounced ``no-adds''), to distinguish them from the somewhat
similar ``nodes'' in hlists and vlists. Certain kinds of ordinary nodes are
allowed to appear in mlists together with the noads; \TeX\ tells the difference
by means of the |type| field, since a noad's |type| is always greater than
that of a node. An mlist does not contain character nodes, hlist nodes, vlist
nodes, math nodes, ligature nodes,
or unset nodes; in particular, each mlist item appears in the
variable-size part of |mem|, so the |type| field is always present.

@ Each noad is four or more words long. The first word contains the |type|
and |subtype| and |link| fields that are already so familiar to us; the
second, third, and fourth words are called the noad's |nucleus|, |subscr|,
and |supscr| fields.

Consider, for example, the simple formula `\.{\$x\^2\$}', which would be
parsed into an mlist containing a single element called an |ord_noad|.
The |nucleus| of this noad is a representation of `\.x', the |subscr| is
empty, and the |supscr| is a representation of `\.2'.

The |nucleus|, |subscr|, and |supscr| fields are further broken into
subfields. If |p| points to a noad, and if |q| is one of its principal
fields (e.g., |q==subscr(p)|), there are several possibilities for the
subfields, depending on the |math_type| of |q|.

\yskip\hang|math_type(q)==math_char| means that |fam(q)| refers to one of
the sixteen font families, and |character(q)| is the number of a character
within a font of that family, as in a character node.

\yskip\hang|math_type(q)==math_text_char| is similar, but the character is
unsubscripted and unsuperscripted and it is followed immediately by another
character from the same font. (This |math_type| setting appears only
briefly during the processing; it is used to suppress unwanted italic
corrections.)

\yskip\hang|math_type(q)==empty| indicates a field with no value (the
corresponding attribute of noad |p| is not present).

\yskip\hang|math_type(q)==sub_box| means that |info(q)| points to a box
node (either an |hlist_node| or a |vlist_node|) that should be used as the
value of the field.  The |shift_amount| in the subsidiary box node is the
amount by which that box will be shifted downward.

\yskip\hang|math_type(q)==sub_mlist| means that |info(q)| points to
an mlist; the mlist must be converted to an hlist in order to obtain
the value of this field.

\yskip\noindent In the latter case, we might have |info(q)==null|. This
is not the same as |math_type(q)==empty|; for example, `\.{\$P\_\{\}\$}'
and `\.{\$P\$}' produce different results (the former will not have the
``italic correction'' added to the width of |P|, but the ``script skip''
will be added).

The definitions of subfields given here are evidently wasteful of space,
since a halfword is being used for the |math_type| although only three
bits would be needed. However, there are hardly ever many noads present at
once, since they are soon converted to nodes that take up even more space,
so we can afford to represent them in whatever way simplifies the
programming.

@ Each portion of a formula is classified as Ord, Op, Bin, Rel, Ope,
Clo, Pun, or Inn, for purposes of spacing and line breaking. An
|ord_noad|, |op_noad|, |bin_noad|, |rel_noad|, |open_noad|, |close_noad|,
|punct_noad|, or |inner_noad| is used to represent portions of the various
types. For example, an `\.=' sign in a formula leads to the creation of a
|rel_noad| whose |nucleus| field is a representation of an equals sign
(usually |fam==0|, |character==075|).  A formula preceded by \.{\\mathrel}
also results in a |rel_noad|.  When a |rel_noad| is followed by an
|op_noad|, say, and possibly separated by one or more ordinary nodes (not
noads), \TeX\ will insert a penalty node (with the current |rel_penalty|)
just after the formula that corresponds to the |rel_noad|, unless there
already was a penalty immediately following; and a ``thick space'' will be
inserted just before the formula that corresponds to the |op_noad|.

A noad of type |ord_noad|, |op_noad|, \dots, |inner_noad| usually
has a |subtype==normal|. The only exception is that an |op_noad| might
have |subtype==limits| or |no_limits|, if the normal positioning of
limits has been overridden for this operator.

@ A |radical_noad| is five words long; the fifth word is the |left_delimiter|
field, which usually represents a square root sign.

A |fraction_noad| is six words long; it has a |right_delimiter| field
as well as a |left_delimiter|.

Delimiter fields are of type |four_quarters|, and they have four subfields
called |small_fam|, |small_char|, |large_fam|, |large_char|. These subfields
represent variable-size delimiters by giving the ``small'' and ``large''
starting characters, as explained in Chapter~17 of {\sl The \TeX book}.
@:TeXbook}{\sl The \TeX book@>

A |fraction_noad| is actually quite different from all other noads. Not
only does it have six words, it has |thickness|, |denominator|, and
|numerator| fields instead of |nucleus|, |subscr|, and |supscr|. The
|thickness| is a scaled value that tells how thick to make a fraction
rule; however, the special value |default_code| is used to stand for the
|default_rule_thickness| of the current size. The |numerator| and
|denominator| point to mlists that define a fraction; we always have
$$\hbox{|math_type(numerator)==math_type(denominator)==sub_mlist|}.$$ The
|left_delimiter| and |right_delimiter| fields specify delimiters that will
be placed at the left and right of the fraction. In this way, a
|fraction_noad| is able to represent all of \TeX's operators \.{\\over},
\.{\\atop}, \.{\\above}, \.{\\overwithdelims}, \.{\\atopwithdelims}, and
 \.{\\abovewithdelims}.

} 

@ A few more kinds of noads will complete the set: An |under_noad| has its
nucleus underlined; an |over_noad| has it overlined. An |accent_noad| places
an accent over its nucleus; the accent character appears as
|fam(accent_chr(p))| and |character(accent_chr(p))|. A |vcenter_noad|
centers its nucleus vertically with respect to the axis of the formula;
in such noads we always have |math_type(nucleus(p))==sub_box|.

And finally, we have |left_noad| and |right_noad| types, to implement
\TeX's \.{\\left} and \.{\\right}. The |nucleus| of such noads is
replaced by a |delimiter| field; thus, for example, `\.{\\left(}' produces
a |left_noad| such that |delimiter(p)| holds the family and character
codes for all left parentheses. A |left_noad| never appears in an mlist
except as the first element, and a |right_noad| never appears in an mlist
except as the last element; furthermore, we either have both a |left_noad|
and a |right_noad|, or neither one is present. The |subscr| and |supscr|
fields are always |empty| in a |left_noad| and a |right_noad|.

@ Math formulas can also contain instructions like \.{\\textstyle} that
override \TeX's normal style rules. A |style_node| is inserted into the
data structure to record such instructions; it is three words long, so it
is considered a node instead of a noad. The |subtype| is either |display_style|
or |text_style| or |script_style| or |script_script_style|. The
second and third words of a |style_node| are not used, but they are
present because a |choice_node| is converted to a |style_node|.

\TeX\ uses even numbers 0, 2, 4, 6 to encode the basic styles
|display_style|, \dots, |script_script_style|, and adds~1 to get the
``cramped'' versions of these styles. This gives a numerical order that
is backwards from the convention of Appendix~G in {\sl The \TeX book\/};
i.e., a smaller style has a larger numerical value.

@ Let's consider now the previously unwritten part of |show_node_list|
that displays the things that can only be present in mlists; this
program illustrates how to access the data structures just defined.

In the context of the following program, |p| points to a node or noad that
should be displayed, and the current string contains the ``recursion history''
that leads to this point. The recursion history consists of a dot for each
outer level in which |p| is subsidiary to some node, or in which |p| is
subsidiary to the |nucleus| field of some noad; the dot is replaced by
`\.\_' or `\.\^' or `\./' or `\.\\' if |p| is descended from the |subscr|
or |supscr| or |denominator| or |numerator| fields of noads. For example,
the current string would be `\.{.\^.\_/}' if |p| points to the |ord_noad| for
|x| in the (ridiculous) formula
`\.{\$\\sqrt\{a\^\{\\mathinner\{b\_\{c\\over x+y\}\}\}\}\$}'.

@* Subroutines for math mode.
In order to convert mlists to hlists, i.e., noads to nodes, we need several
subroutines that are conveniently dealt with now.

Let us first introduce the macros that make it easy to get at the parameters and
other font information. A size code, which is a multiple of 16, is added to a
family number to get an index into the table of internal font numbers
for each combination of family and size.  (Be alert: Size codes get
larger as the type gets smaller.)

@d text_size	0 /*size code for the largest size in a family*/ 
@d script_size	16 /*size code for the medium size in a family*/ 
@d script_script_size	32 /*size code for the smallest size in a family*/ 

@<Basic printing procedures@>=
void print_size(int @!s)
{@+if (s==text_size) print_esc(@[@<|"textfont"|@>@]);
else if (s==script_size) print_esc(@[@<|"scriptfont"|@>@]);
else print_esc(@[@<|"scriptscriptfont"|@>@]);
} 

@ Before an mlist is converted to an hlist, \TeX\ makes sure that
the fonts in family~2 have enough parameters to be math-symbol
fonts, and that the fonts in family~3 have enough parameters to be
math-extension fonts. The math-symbol parameters are referred to by using the
following macros, which take a size code as their parameter; for example,
|num1(cur_size)| gives the value of the |num1| parameter for the current size.
@^parameters for symbols@>
@^font parameters@>

@d mathsy_end(X)	fam_fnt(2+X)]].sc
@d mathsy(X)	font_info[X+param_base[mathsy_end
@d math_x_height	mathsy(5) /*height of `\.x'*/ 
@d math_quad	mathsy(6) /*\.{18mu}*/ 
@d num1	mathsy(8) /*numerator shift-up in display styles*/ 
@d num2	mathsy(9) /*numerator shift-up in non-display, non-\.{\\atop}*/ 
@d num3	mathsy(10) /*numerator shift-up in non-display \.{\\atop}*/ 
@d denom1	mathsy(11) /*denominator shift-down in display styles*/ 
@d denom2	mathsy(12) /*denominator shift-down in non-display styles*/ 
@d sup1	mathsy(13) /*superscript shift-up in uncramped display style*/ 
@d sup2	mathsy(14) /*superscript shift-up in uncramped non-display*/ 
@d sup3	mathsy(15) /*superscript shift-up in cramped styles*/ 
@d sub1	mathsy(16) /*subscript shift-down if superscript is absent*/ 
@d sub2	mathsy(17) /*subscript shift-down if superscript is present*/ 
@d sup_drop	mathsy(18) /*superscript baseline below top of large box*/ 
@d sub_drop	mathsy(19) /*subscript baseline below bottom of large box*/ 
@d delim1	mathsy(20) /*size of \.{\\atopwithdelims} delimiters
  in display styles*/ 
@d delim2	mathsy(21) /*size of \.{\\atopwithdelims} delimiters in non-displays*/ 
@d axis_height	mathsy(22) /*height of fraction lines above the baseline*/ 
@d total_mathsy_params	22

@ The math-extension parameters have similar macros, but the size code is
omitted (since it is always |cur_size| when we refer to such parameters).
@^parameters for symbols@>
@^font parameters@>

@d mathex(X)	font_info[X+param_base[fam_fnt(3+cur_size)]].sc
@d default_rule_thickness	mathex(8) /*thickness of \.{\\over} bars*/ 
@d big_op_spacing1	mathex(9) /*minimum clearance above a displayed op*/ 
@d big_op_spacing2	mathex(10) /*minimum clearance below a displayed op*/ 
@d big_op_spacing3	mathex(11) /*minimum baselineskip above displayed op*/ 
@d big_op_spacing4	mathex(12) /*minimum baselineskip below displayed op*/ 
@d big_op_spacing5	mathex(13) /*padding above and below displayed limits*/ 
@d total_mathex_params	13

@ We also need to compute the change in style between mlists and their
subsidiaries. The following macros define the subsidiary style for
an overlined nucleus (|cramped_style|), for a subscript or a superscript
(|sub_style| or |sup_style|), or for a numerator or denominator (|num_style|
or |denom_style|).

@d cramped_style(X)	2*(X/2)+cramped /*cramp the style*/ 
@d sub_style(X)	2*(X/4)+script_style+cramped /*smaller and cramped*/ 
@d sup_style(X)	2*(X/4)+script_style+(X%2) /*smaller*/ 
@d num_style(X)	X+2-2*(X/6) /*smaller unless already script-script*/ 
@d denom_style(X)	2*(X/2)+cramped+2-2*(X/6) /*smaller, cramped*/ 

@ When the style changes, the following piece of program computes associated
information:

@<Set up the values of |cur_size| and |cur_mu|, based on |cur_style|@>=
{@+if (cur_style < script_style) cur_size=text_size;
else cur_size=16*((cur_style-text_style)/2);
cur_mu=x_over_n(math_quad(cur_size), 18);
} 

@ Here is a function that returns a pointer to a rule node having a given
thickness |t|. The rule will extend horizontally to the boundary of the vlist
that eventually contains it.

@p pointer fraction_rule(scaled @!t)
   /*construct the bar for a fraction*/ 
{@+pointer p; /*the new node*/ 
p=new_rule();height(p)=t;depth(p)=0;return p;
} 

@ The |overbar| function returns a pointer to a vlist box that consists of
a given box |b|, above which has been placed a kern of height |k| under a
fraction rule of thickness |t| under additional space of height |t|.

@p pointer overbar(pointer @!b, scaled @!k, scaled @!t)
{@+pointer p, @!q; /*nodes being constructed*/ 
p=new_kern(k);link(p)=b;q=fraction_rule(t);link(q)=p;
p=new_kern(t);link(p)=q;return vpack(p, natural);
} 

@ The |var_delimiter| function, which finds or constructs a sufficiently
large delimiter, is the most interesting of the auxiliary functions that
currently concern us. Given a pointer |d| to a delimiter field in some noad,
together with a size code |s| and a vertical distance |v|, this function
returns a pointer to a box that contains the smallest variant of |d| whose
height plus depth is |v| or more. (And if no variant is large enough, it
returns the largest available variant.) In particular, this routine will
construct arbitrarily large delimiters from extensible components, if
|d| leads to such characters.

The value returned is a box whose |shift_amount| has been set so that
the box is vertically centered with respect to the axis in the given size.
If a built-up symbol is returned, the height of the box before shifting
will be the height of its topmost component.

The centering is done by putting \.{\\hss} glue at the left and right

actual box might not really be centered, if it already contains
infinite glue.

@* Typesetting math formulas.
\TeX's most important routine for dealing with formulas is called
|mlist_to_hlist|.  After a formula has been scanned and represented as an
mlist, this routine converts it to an hlist that can be placed into a box
or incorporated into the text of a paragraph. There are three implicit
parameters, passed in global variables: |cur_mlist| points to the first
node or noad in the given mlist (and it might be |null|); |cur_style| is a
style code; and |mlist_penalties| is |true| if penalty nodes for potential
line breaks are to be inserted into the resulting hlist. After
|mlist_to_hlist| has acted, |link(temp_head)| points to the translated hlist.

Since mlists can be inside mlists, the procedure is recursive. And since this
is not part of \TeX's inner loop, the program has been written in a manner
that stresses compactness over efficiency.
@^recursion@>

@<Glob...@>=
pointer @!cur_mlist; /*beginning of mlist to be translated*/ 
small_number @!cur_style; /*style code at current place in the list*/ 
small_number @!cur_size; /*size code corresponding to |cur_style|*/ 
scaled @!cur_mu; /*the math unit width corresponding to |cur_size|*/ 
bool @!mlist_penalties; /*should |mlist_to_hlist| insert penalties?*/ 

@ The recursion in |mlist_to_hlist| is due primarily to a subroutine
called |clean_box| that puts a given noad field into a box using a given
math style; |mlist_to_hlist| can call |clean_box|, which can call
|mlist_to_hlist|.
@^recursion@>

The box returned by |clean_box| is ``clean'' in the
sense that its |shift_amount| is zero.

@ We need to do a lot of different things, so |mlist_to_hlist| makes two
passes over the given mlist.

The first pass does most of the processing: It removes ``mu'' spacing from
glue, it recursively evaluates all subsidiary mlists so that only the
top-level mlist remains to be handled, it puts fractions and square roots
and such things into boxes, it attaches subscripts and superscripts, and
it computes the overall height and depth of the top-level mlist so that
the size of delimiters for a |left_noad| and a |right_noad| will be known.
The hlist resulting from each noad is recorded in that noad's |new_hlist|
field, an integer field that replaces the |nucleus| or |thickness|.

The second pass eliminates all noads and inserts the correct glue and
penalties between nodes.

@* Alignment.
It's sort of a miracle whenever \.{\\halign} and \.{\\valign} work, because
they cut across so many of the control structures of \TeX.

Therefore the
present page is probably not the best place for a beginner to start reading
this program; it is better to master everything else first.

Let us focus our thoughts on an example of what the input might be, in order
to get some idea about how the alignment miracle happens. The example doesn't
do anything useful, but it is sufficiently general to indicate all of the
special cases that must be dealt with; please do not be disturbed by its
apparent complexity and meaninglessness.
$$\vbox{\halign{\.{#}\hfil\cr
{}\\tabskip 2pt plus 3pt\cr
{}\\halign to 300pt\{u1\#v1\&\cr
\hskip 50pt\\tabskip 1pt plus 1fil u2\#v2\&\cr
\hskip 50pt u3\#v3\\cr\cr
\hskip 25pt a1\&\\omit a2\&\\vrule\\cr\cr
\hskip 25pt \\noalign\{\\vskip 3pt\}\cr
\hskip 25pt b1\\span b2\\cr\cr
\hskip 25pt \\omit\&c2\\span\\omit\\cr\}\cr}}$$
Here's what happens:

\yskip
(0) When `\.{\\halign to 300pt\{}' is scanned, the |scan_spec| routine
places the 300pt dimension onto the |save_stack|, and an |align_group|
code is placed above it. This will make it possible to complete the alignment
when the matching `\.\}' is found.

(1) The preamble is scanned next. Macros in the preamble are not expanded,
@^preamble@>
except as part of a tabskip specification. For example, if \.{u2} had been
a macro in the preamble above, it would have been expanded, since \TeX\
must look for `\.{minus...}' as part of the tabskip glue. A ``preamble list''
is constructed based on the user's preamble; in our case it contains the
following seven items:
$$\vbox{\halign{\.{#}\hfil\qquad&(#)\hfil\cr
{}\\glue 2pt plus 3pt&the tabskip preceding column 1\cr
{}\\alignrecord, width $-\infty$&preamble info for column 1\cr
{}\\glue 2pt plus 3pt&the tabskip between columns 1 and 2\cr
{}\\alignrecord, width $-\infty$&preamble info for column 2\cr
{}\\glue 1pt plus 1fil&the tabskip between columns 2 and 3\cr
{}\\alignrecord, width $-\infty$&preamble info for column 3\cr
{}\\glue 1pt plus 1fil&the tabskip following column 3\cr}}$$
These ``alignrecord'' entries have the same size as an |unset_node|,
since they will later be converted into such nodes. However, at the
moment they have no |type| or |subtype| fields; they have |info| fields
instead, and these |info| fields are initially set to the value |end_span|,
for reasons explained below. Furthermore, the alignrecord nodes have no
|height| or |depth| fields; these are renamed |u_part| and |v_part|,
and they point to token lists for the templates of the alignment.
For example, the |u_part| field in the first alignrecord points to the
token list `\.{u1}', i.e., the template preceding the `\.\#' for column~1.

(2) \TeX\ now looks at what follows the \.{\\cr} that ended the preamble.
It is not `\.{\\noalign}' or `\.{\\omit}', so this input is put back to
be read again, and the template `\.{u1}' is fed to the scanner. Just
before reading `\.{u1}', \TeX\ goes into restricted horizontal mode.
Just after reading `\.{u1}', \TeX\ will see `\.{a1}', and then (when the
{\.\&} is sensed) \TeX\ will see `\.{v1}'. Then \TeX\ scans an |endv|
token, indicating the end of a column. At this point an |unset_node| is
created, containing the contents of the current hlist (i.e., `\.{u1a1v1}').
The natural width of this unset node replaces the |width| field of the
alignrecord for column~1; in general, the alignrecords will record the
maximum natural width that has occurred so far in a given column.

(3) Since `\.{\\omit}' follows the `\.\&', the templates for column~2
are now bypassed. Again \TeX\ goes into restricted horizontal mode and
makes an |unset_node| from the resulting hlist; but this time the
hlist contains simply `\.{a2}'. The natural width of the new unset box
is remembered in the |width| field of the alignrecord for column~2.

(4) A third |unset_node| is created for column 3, using essentially the
mechanism that worked for column~1; this unset box contains `\.{u3\\vrule
v3}'. The vertical rule in this case has running dimensions that will later
extend to the height and depth of the whole first row, since each |unset_node|
in a row will eventually inherit the height and depth of its enclosing box.

(5) The first row has now ended; it is made into a single unset box
comprising the following seven items:
$$\vbox{\halign{\hbox to 325pt{\qquad\.{#}\hfil}\cr
{}\\glue 2pt plus 3pt\cr
{}\\unsetbox for 1 column: u1a1v1\cr
{}\\glue 2pt plus 3pt\cr
{}\\unsetbox for 1 column: a2\cr
{}\\glue 1pt plus 1fil\cr
{}\\unsetbox for 1 column: u3\\vrule v3\cr
{}\\glue 1pt plus 1fil\cr}}$$
The width of this unset row is unimportant, but it has the correct height
and depth, so the correct baselineskip glue will be computed as the row
is inserted into a vertical list.

(6) Since `\.{\\noalign}' follows the current \.{\\cr}, \TeX\ appends
additional material (in this case \.{\\vskip 3pt}) to the vertical list.
While processing this material, \TeX\ will be in internal vertical
mode, and |no_align_group| will be on |save_stack|.

(7) The next row produces an unset box that looks like this:
$$\vbox{\halign{\hbox to 325pt{\qquad\.{#}\hfil}\cr
{}\\glue 2pt plus 3pt\cr
{}\\unsetbox for 2 columns: u1b1v1u2b2v2\cr
{}\\glue 1pt plus 1fil\cr
{}\\unsetbox for 1 column: {\rm(empty)}\cr
{}\\glue 1pt plus 1fil\cr}}$$
The natural width of the unset box that spans columns 1~and~2 is stored
in a ``span node,'' which we will explain later; the |info| field of the
alignrecord for column~1 now points to the new span node, and the |info|
of the span node points to |end_span|.

(8) The final row produces the unset box
$$\vbox{\halign{\hbox to 325pt{\qquad\.{#}\hfil}\cr
{}\\glue 2pt plus 3pt\cr
{}\\unsetbox for 1 column: {\rm(empty)}\cr
{}\\glue 2pt plus 3pt\cr
{}\\unsetbox for 2 columns: u2c2v2\cr
{}\\glue 1pt plus 1fil\cr}}$$
A new span node is attached to the alignrecord for column 2.

(9) The last step is to compute the true column widths and to change all the
unset boxes to hboxes, appending the whole works to the vertical list that
encloses the \.{\\halign}. The rules for deciding on the final widths of
each unset column box will be explained below.

\yskip\noindent
Note that as \.{\\halign} is being processed, we fearlessly give up control
to the rest of \TeX. At critical junctures, an alignment routine is
called upon to step in and do some little action, but most of the time
these routines just lurk in the background. It's something like
post-hypnotic suggestion.

@ We have mentioned that alignrecords contain no |height| or |depth| fields.
Their |glue_sign| and |glue_order| are pre-empted as well, since it
is necessary to store information about what to do when a template ends.
This information is called the |extra_info| field.

@d u_part(X)	mem[X+height_offset].i /*pointer to \<u_j> token list*/ 
@d v_part(X)	mem[X+depth_offset].i /*pointer to \<v_j> token list*/ 
@d extra_info(X)	info(X+list_offset) /*info to remember during template*/ 

@ Alignments can occur within alignments, so a small stack is used to access
the alignrecord information. At each level we have a |preamble| pointer,
indicating the beginning of the preamble list; a |cur_align| pointer,
indicating the current position in the preamble list; a |cur_span| pointer,
indicating the value of |cur_align| at the beginning of a sequence of
spanned columns; a |cur_loop| pointer, indicating the tabskip glue before
an alignrecord that should be copied next if the current list is extended;
and the |align_state| variable, which indicates the nesting of braces so
that \.{\\cr} and \.{\\span} and tab marks are properly intercepted.
There also are pointers |cur_head| and |cur_tail| to the head and tail
of a list of adjustments being moved out from horizontal mode to
vertical~mode.

The current values of these seven quantities appear in global variables;
when they have to be pushed down, they are stored in 5-word nodes, and
|align_ptr| points to the topmost such node.

@d preamble	link(align_head) /*the current preamble list*/

} 

@ \TeX\ has eight procedures that govern alignments: |init_align| and
|fin_align| are used at the very beginning and the very end; |init_row| and
|fin_row| are used at the beginning and end of individual rows; |init_span|
is used at the beginning of a sequence of spanned columns (possibly involving
only one column); |init_col| and |fin_col| are used at the beginning and
end of individual columns; and |align_peek| is used after \.{\\cr} to see
whether the next item is \.{\\noalign}.

We shall consider these routines in the order they are first used during
the course of a complete \.{\\halign}, namely |init_align|, |align_peek|,
|init_row|, |init_span|, |init_col|, |fin_col|, |fin_row|, |fin_align|.

@ When \.{\\halign} or \.{\\valign} has been scanned in an appropriate
mode, \TeX\ calls |init_align|, whose task is to get everything off to a
good start. This mostly involves scanning the preamble and putting its
information into the preamble list.

@ The tricky part about alignments is getting the templates into the
scanner at the right time, and recovering control when a row or column
is finished.

We usually begin a row after each \.{\\cr} has been sensed, unless that
\.{\\cr} is followed by \.{\\noalign} or by the right brace that terminates
the alignment. The |align_peek| routine is used to look ahead and do
the right thing; it either gets a new row started, or gets a \.{\\noalign}
started, or finishes off the alignment.

@ To start a row (i.e., a `row' that rhymes with `dough' but not with `bough'),

@ It's time now to dismantle the preamble list and to compute the column
widths. Let $w_{ij}$ be the maximum of the natural widths of all entries
that span columns $i$ through $j$, inclusive. The alignrecord for column~$i$
contains $w_{ii}$ in its |width| field, and there is also a linked list of
the nonzero $w_{ij}$ for increasing $j$, accessible via the |info| field;
these span nodes contain the value $j-i+|min_quarterword|$ in their
|link| fields. The values of $w_{ii}$ were initialized to |null_flag|, which
we regard as $-\infty$.

The final column widths are defined by the formula
$$w_j=\max_{1\L i\L j}\biggl( w_{ij}-\sum_{i\L k<j}(t_k+w_k)\biggr),$$
where $t_k$ is the natural width of the tabskip glue between columns
$k$ and~$k+1$. However, if $w_{ij}=-\infty$ for all |i| in the range
|1 <= i <= j| (i.e., if every entry that involved column~|j| also involved
column~|j+1|), we let $w_j=0$, and we zero out the tabskip glue after
column~|j|.

\TeX\ computes these values by using the following scheme: First $w_1=w_{11}$.
Then replace $w_{2j}$ by $\max(w_{2j},w_{1j}-t_1-w_1)$, for all $j>1$.
Then $w_2=w_{22}$. Then replace $w_{3j}$ by $\max(w_{3j},w_{2j}-t_2-w_2)$
for all $j>2$; and so on. If any $w_j$ turns out to be $-\infty$, its
value is changed to zero and so is the next tabskip.

@* Breaking paragraphs into lines.
We come now to what is probably the most interesting algorithm of \TeX:
the mechanism for choosing the ``best possible'' breakpoints that yield
the individual lines of a paragraph. \TeX's line-breaking algorithm takes
a given horizontal list and converts it to a sequence of boxes that are
appended to the current vertical list. In the course of doing this, it
creates a special data structure containing three kinds of records that are
not used elsewhere in \TeX. Such nodes are created while a paragraph is
being processed, and they are destroyed afterwards; thus, the other parts
of \TeX\ do not need to know anything about how line-breaking is done.

The method used here is based on an approach devised by Michael F. Plass and
@^Plass, Michael Frederick@>
@^Knuth, Donald Ervin@>
the author in 1977, subsequently generalized and improved by the same two
people in 1980. A detailed discussion appears in {\sl SOFTWARE---Practice
\AM\ Experience \bf11} (1981), 1119--1184, where it is shown that the
line-breaking problem can be regarded as a special case of the problem of
computing the shortest path in an acyclic network. The cited paper includes
numerous examples and describes the history of line breaking as it has been
practiced by printers through the ages. The present implementation adds two
new ideas to the algorithm of 1980: Memory space requirements are considerably
reduced by using smaller records for inactive nodes than for active ones,
and arithmetic overflow is avoided by using ``delta distances'' instead of
keeping track of the total distance from the beginning of the paragraph to the
current point.

@ The |line_break| procedure should be invoked only in horizontal mode; it
leaves that mode and places its output into the current vlist of the
enclosing vertical mode (or internal vertical mode).
There is one explicit parameter:  |final_widow_penalty| is the amount of
additional penalty to be inserted before the final line of the paragraph.

There are also a number of implicit parameters: The hlist to be broken
starts at |link(head)|, and it is nonempty. The value of |prev_graf| in the
enclosing semantic level tells where the paragraph should begin in the
sequence of line numbers, in case hanging indentation or \.{\\parshape}
is in use; |prev_graf| is zero unless this paragraph is being continued
after a displayed formula.  Other implicit parameters, such as the
|par_shape_ptr| and various penalties to use for hyphenation, etc., appear
in |eqtb|.

After |line_break| has acted, it will have updated the current vlist and the
value of |prev_graf|. Furthermore, the global variable |just_box| will
point to the final box created by |line_break|, so that the width of this
line can be ascertained when it is necessary to decide whether to use
|above_display_skip| or |above_display_short_skip| before a displayed formula.

@<Glob...@>=
pointer @!just_box; /*the |hlist_node| for the last line of the new paragraph*/ 

@ Since |line_break| is a rather lengthy procedure---sort of a small world unto
itself---we must build it up little by little, somewhat more cautiously
than we have done with the simpler procedures of \TeX. Here is the
general outline.

} 

@ The first task is to move the list from |head| to |temp_head| and go
into the enclosing semantic level. We also append the \.{\\parfillskip}
glue to the end of the paragraph, removing a space (or other glue node) if
it was there, since spaces usually precede blank lines and instances of
`\.{\$\$}'. The |par_fill_skip| is preceded by an infinite penalty, so
it will never be considered as a potential breakpoint.

This code assumes that a |glue_node| and a |penalty_node| occupy the
same number of |mem|~words.

@ When looking for optimal line breaks, \TeX\ creates a ``break node'' for
each break that is {\sl feasible}, in the sense that there is a way to end
a line at the given place without requiring any line to stretch more than
a given tolerance. A break node is characterized by three things: the position
of the break (which is a pointer to a |glue_node|, |math_node|, |penalty_node|,
or |disc_node|); the ordinal number of the line that will follow this
breakpoint; and the fitness classification of the line that has just
ended, i.e., |tight_fit|, |decent_fit|, |loose_fit|, or |very_loose_fit|.

@d tight_fit	3 /*fitness classification for lines shrinking 0.5 to 1.0 of their
  shrinkability*/ 
@d loose_fit	1 /*fitness classification for lines stretching 0.5 to 1.0 of their
  stretchability*/ 
@d very_loose_fit	0 /*fitness classification for lines stretching more than
  their stretchability*/ 
@d decent_fit	2 /*fitness classification for all other lines*/ 

@ The algorithm essentially determines the best possible way to achieve
each feasible combination of position, line, and fitness. Thus, it answers
questions like, ``What is the best way to break the opening part of the
paragraph so that the fourth line is a tight line ending at such-and-such
a place?'' However, the fact that all lines are to be the same length
after a certain point makes it possible to regard all sufficiently large
line numbers as equivalent, when the looseness parameter is zero, and this
makes it possible for the algorithm to save space and time.

An ``active node'' and a ``passive node'' are created in |mem| for each
feasible breakpoint that needs to be considered. Active nodes are three
words long and passive nodes are two words long. We need active nodes only
for breakpoints near the place in the paragraph that is currently being
examined, so they are recycled within a comparatively short time after
they are created.

@ An active node for a given breakpoint contains six fields:

\yskip\hang|link| points to the next node in the list of active nodes; the
last active node has |link==last_active|.

\yskip\hang|break_node| points to the passive node associated with this
breakpoint.

\yskip\hang|line_number| is the number of the line that follows this
breakpoint.

\yskip\hang|fitness| is the fitness classification of the line ending at this
breakpoint.

\yskip\hang|type| is either |hyphenated| or |unhyphenated|, depending on
whether this breakpoint is a |disc_node|.

\yskip\hang|total_demerits| is the minimum possible sum of demerits over all
lines leading from the beginning of the paragraph to this breakpoint.

\yskip\noindent
The value of |link(active)| points to the first active node on a linked list
of all currently active nodes. This list is in order by |line_number|,
except that nodes with |line_number > easy_line| may be in any order relative
to each other.

@d active_node_size	3 /*number of words in active nodes*/ 
@d fitness	subtype /*|very_loose_fit dotdot tight_fit| on final line for this break*/ 
@d break_node	rlink /*pointer to the corresponding passive node*/

@ @<Initialize the special list heads...@>=
type(last_active)=hyphenated;line_number(last_active)=max_halfword;
subtype(last_active)=0; /*the |subtype| is never examined by the algorithm*/ 

@ The passive node for a given breakpoint contains only four fields:

\yskip\hang|link| points to the passive node created just before this one,
if any, otherwise it is |null|.

\yskip\hang|cur_break| points to the position of this breakpoint in the
horizontal list for the paragraph being broken.

\yskip\hang|prev_break| points to the passive node that should precede this
one in an optimal path to this breakpoint.

\yskip\hang|serial| is equal to |n| if this passive node is the |n|th
one created during the current pass. (This field is used only when
printing out detailed statistics about the line-breaking calculations.)

\yskip\noindent
There is a global variable called |passive| that points to the most
recently created passive node. Another global variable, |printed_node|,
is used to help print out the paragraph when detailed information about
the line-breaking computation is being displayed.

@d passive_node_size	2 /*number of words in passive nodes*/ 
@d cur_break	rlink /*in passive node, points to position of this breakpoint*/ 
@d prev_break	llink /*points to passive node that should precede this one*/

@<Glob...@>=
pointer @!passive; /*most recent node on passive list*/ 
pointer @!printed_node; /*most recent node that has been printed*/ 
halfword @!pass_number; /*the number of passive nodes allocated on this pass*/ 

@ The active list also contains ``delta'' nodes that help the algorithm
compute the badness of individual lines. Such nodes appear only between two
active nodes, and they have |type==delta_node|. If |p| and |r| are active nodes
and if |q| is a delta node between them, so that |link(p)==q| and |link(q)==r|,
then |q| tells the space difference between lines in the horizontal list that
start after breakpoint |p| and lines that start after breakpoint |r|. In
other words, if we know the length of the line that starts after |p| and
ends at our current position, then the corresponding length of the line that
starts after |r| is obtained by adding the amounts in node~|q|. A delta node
contains six scaled numbers, since it must record the net change in glue
stretchability with respect to all orders of infinity. The natural width
difference appears in |mem[q+1].sc|; the stretch differences in units of
pt, fil, fill, and filll appear in |mem[q+2 dotdot q+5].sc|; and the shrink difference
appears in |mem[q+6].sc|. The |subtype| field of a delta node is not used.

@d delta_node_size	7 /*number of words in a delta node*/ 
@d delta_node	2 /*|type| field in a delta node*/ 

@ As the algorithm runs, it maintains a set of six delta-like registers
for the length of the line following the first active breakpoint to the
current position in the given hlist. When it makes a pass through the
active list, it also maintains a similar set of six registers for the
length following the active breakpoint of current interest. A third set
holds the length of an empty line (namely, the sum of \.{\\leftskip} and
\.{\\rightskip}); and a fourth set is used to create new delta nodes.

When we pass a delta node we want to do operations like
$$\hbox{\ignorespaces|for
k=1 to 6 do cur_active_width[k]=cur_active_width[k]+mem[q+k].sc|};$$ and we
want to do this without the overhead of |for| loops. The |do_all_six|
macro makes such six-tuples convenient.

scaled @!break_width0[6], *const @!break_width = @!break_width0-1; /*length being computed after current break*/ 

@ Let's state the principles of the delta nodes more precisely and concisely,
so that the following programs will be less obscure. For each legal
breakpoint~|p| in the paragraph, we define two quantities $\alpha(p)$ and
$\beta(p)$ such that the length of material in a line from breakpoint~|p|
to breakpoint~|q| is $\gamma+\beta(q)-\alpha(p)$, for some fixed $\gamma$.
Intuitively, $\alpha(p)$ and $\beta(q)$ are the total length of material from
the beginning of the paragraph to a point ``after'' a break at |p| and to a
point ``before'' a break at |q|; and $\gamma$ is the width of an empty line,
namely the length contributed by \.{\\leftskip} and \.{\\rightskip}.

Suppose, for example, that the paragraph consists entirely of alternating
boxes and glue skips; let the boxes have widths $x_1\ldots x_n$ and
let the skips have widths $y_1\ldots y_n$, so that the paragraph can be
represented by $x_1y_1\ldots x_ny_n$. Let $p_i$ be the legal breakpoint
at $y_i$; then $\alpha(p_i)=x_1+y_1+\cdots+x_i+y_i$, and $\beta(p_i)=
x_1+y_1+\cdots+x_i$. To check this, note that the length of material from
$p_2$ to $p_5$, say, is $\gamma+x_3+y_3+x_4+y_4+x_5=\gamma+\beta(p_5)
-\alpha(p_2)$.

The quantities $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ involve glue stretchability and
shrinkability as well as a natural width. If we were to compute $\alpha(p)$
and $\beta(p)$ for each |p|, we would need multiple precision arithmetic, and
the multiprecise numbers would have to be kept in the active nodes.
\TeX\ avoids this problem by working entirely with relative differences
or ``deltas.'' Suppose, for example, that the active list contains
$a_1\,\delta_1\,a_2\,\delta_2\,a_3$, where the |a|'s are active breakpoints
and the $\delta$'s are delta nodes. Then $\delta_1=\alpha(a_1)-\alpha(a_2)$
and $\delta_2=\alpha(a_2)-\alpha(a_3)$. If the line breaking algorithm is
currently positioned at some other breakpoint |p|, the |active_width| array
contains the value $\gamma+\beta(p)-\alpha(a_1)$. If we are scanning through
the list of active nodes and considering a tentative line that runs from
$a_2$ to~|p|, say, the |cur_active_width| array will contain the value
$\gamma+\beta(p)-\alpha(a_2)$. Thus, when we move from $a_2$ to $a_3$,
we want to add $\alpha(a_2)-\alpha(a_3)$ to |cur_active_width|; and this
is just $\delta_2$, which appears in the active list between $a_2$ and
$a_3$. The |background| array contains $\gamma$. The |break_width| array
will be used to calculate values of new delta nodes when the active
list is being updated.

@ Glue nodes in a horizontal list that is being paragraphed are not supposed to
include ``infinite'' shrinkability; that is why the algorithm maintains
four registers for stretching but only one for shrinking. If the user tries to
introduce infinite shrinkability, the shrinkability will be reset to finite
and an error message will be issued. A boolean variable |no_shrink_error_yet|
prevents this error message from appearing more than once per paragraph.

@ A pointer variable |cur_p| runs through the given horizontal list as we look
for breakpoints. This variable is global, since it is used both by |line_break|
and by its subprocedure |try_break|.

Another global variable called |threshold| is used to determine the feasibility
of individual lines: Breakpoints are feasible if there is a way to reach
them without creating lines whose badness exceeds |threshold|.  (The
badness is compared to |threshold| before penalties are added, so that
penalty values do not affect the feasibility of breakpoints, except that
no break is allowed when the penalty is 10000 or more.) If |threshold|
is 10000 or more, all legal breaks are considered feasible, since the
|badness| function specified above never returns a value greater than~10000.

Up to three passes might be made through the paragraph in an attempt to find at
least one set of feasible breakpoints. On the first pass, we have
|threshold==pretolerance| and |second_pass==final_pass==false|.
If this pass fails to find a
feasible solution, |threshold| is set to |tolerance|, |second_pass| is set
|true|, and an attempt is made to hyphenate as many words as possible.
If that fails too, we add |emergency_stretch| to the background
stretchability and set |final_pass==true|.

bool @!second_pass; /*is this our second attempt to break this paragraph?*/ 
bool @!final_pass; /*is this our final attempt to break this paragraph?*/ 
int @!threshold; /*maximum badness on feasible lines*/ 

@ The heart of the line-breaking procedure is `|try_break|', a subroutine
that tests if the current breakpoint |cur_p| is feasible, by running
through the active list to see what lines of text can be made from active
nodes to~|cur_p|.  If feasible breaks are possible, new break nodes are
created.  If |cur_p| is too far from an active node, that node is
deactivated.

The parameter |pi| to |try_break| is the penalty associated
with a break at |cur_p|; we have |pi==eject_penalty| if the break is forced,
and |pi==inf_penalty| if the break is illegal.

The other parameter, |break_type|, is set to |hyphenated| or |unhyphenated|,
depending on whether or not the current break is at a |disc_node|. The
end of a paragraph is also regarded as `|hyphenated|'; this case is
distinguishable by the condition |cur_p==null|.

@ When we insert a new active node for a break at |cur_p|, suppose this
new node is to be placed just before active node |a|; then we essentially
want to insert `$\delta\,|cur_p|\,\delta^\prime$' before |a|, where
$\delta=\alpha(a)-\alpha(|cur_p|)$ and $\delta^\prime=\alpha(|cur_p|)-\alpha(a)$
in the notation explained above.  The |cur_active_width| array now holds
$\gamma+\beta(|cur_p|)-\alpha(a)$; so $\delta$ can be obtained by
subtracting |cur_active_width| from the quantity $\gamma+\beta(|cur_p|)-
\alpha(|cur_p|)$. The latter quantity can be regarded as the length of a
line ``from |cur_p| to |cur_p|''; we call it the |break_width| at |cur_p|.

The |break_width| is usually negative, since it consists of the background
(which is normally zero) minus the width of nodes following~|cur_p| that are
eliminated after a break. If, for example, node |cur_p| is a glue node, the
width of this glue is subtracted from the background; and we also look
ahead to eliminate all subsequent glue and penalty and kern and math
nodes, subtracting their widths as well.

Kern nodes do not disappear at a line break unless they are |explicit|.

@ When |cur_p| is a discretionary break, the length of a line ``from |cur_p| to
|cur_p|'' has to be defined properly so that the other calculations work out.
Suppose that the pre-break text at |cur_p| has length $l_0$, the post-break
text has length $l_1$, and the replacement text has length |l|. Suppose
also that |q| is the node following the replacement text. Then length of a
line from |cur_p| to |q| will be computed as $\gamma+\beta(q)-\alpha(|cur_p|)$,
where $\beta(q)=\beta(|cur_p|)-l_0+l$. The actual length will be the background
plus $l_1$, so the length from |cur_p| to |cur_p| should be $\gamma+l_0+l_1-l$.
If the post-break text of the discretionary is empty, a break may also
discard~|q|; in that unusual case we subtract the length of~|q| and any
other nodes that will be discarded after the discretionary break.

The value of $l_0$ need not be computed, since |line_break| will put
it into the global variable |disc_width| before calling |try_break|.

@* Breaking paragraphs into lines, continued.
So far we have gotten a little way into the |line_break| routine, having
covered its important |try_break| subroutine. Now let's consider the
rest of the process.

The main loop of |line_break| traverses the given hlist,
starting at |link(temp_head)|, and calls |try_break| at each legal
breakpoint. A variable called |auto_breaking| is set to true except
within math formulas, since glue nodes are not legal breakpoints when
they appear in formulas.

The current node of interest in the hlist is pointed to by |cur_p|. Another
variable, |prev_p|, is usually one step behind |cur_p|, but the real
meaning of |prev_p| is this: If |type(cur_p)==glue_node| then |cur_p| is a legal
breakpoint if and only if |auto_breaking| is true and |prev_p| does not
point to a glue node, penalty node, explicit kern node, or math node.

The following declarations provide for a few other local variables that are
used in special calculations.

@<Local variables for line breaking@>=
bool @!auto_breaking; /*is node |cur_p| outside a formula?*/ 
pointer @!prev_p; /*helps to determine when glue nodes are breakpoints*/

@* Pre-hyphenation.
When the line-breaking routine is unable to find a feasible sequence of
breakpoints, it makes a second pass over the paragraph, attempting to
hyphenate the hyphenatable words. The goal of hyphenation is to insert
discretionary material into the paragraph so that there are more
potential places to break.

The general rules for hyphenation are somewhat complex and technical,
because we want to be able to hyphenate words that are preceded or
followed by punctuation marks, and because we want the rules to work
for languages other than English. We also must contend with the fact
that hyphens might radically alter the ligature and kerning structure
of a word.

A sequence of characters will be considered for hyphenation only if it
belongs to a ``potentially hyphenatable part'' of the current paragraph.
This is a sequence of nodes $p_0p_1\ldots p_m$ where $p_0$ is a glue node,
$p_1\ldots p_{m-1}$ are either character or ligature or whatsit or
implicit kern nodes, and $p_m$ is a glue or penalty or insertion or adjust
or mark or whatsit or explicit kern node.  (Therefore hyphenation is
disabled by boxes, math formulas, and discretionary nodes already inserted
by the user.) The ligature nodes among $p_1\ldots p_{m-1}$ are effectively
expanded into the original non-ligature characters; the kern nodes and
whatsits are ignored. Each character |c| is now classified as either a
nonletter (if |lc_code(c)==0|), a lowercase letter (if
|lc_code(c)==c|), or an uppercase letter (otherwise); an uppercase letter
is treated as if it were |lc_code(c)| for purposes of hyphenation. The
characters generated by $p_1\ldots p_{m-1}$ may begin with nonletters; let
$c_1$ be the first letter that is not in the middle of a ligature. Whatsit
nodes preceding $c_1$ are ignored; a whatsit found after $c_1$ will be the
terminating node $p_m$. All characters that do not have the same font as
$c_1$ will be treated as nonletters. The |hyphen_char| for that font
must be between 0 and 255, otherwise hyphenation will not be attempted.
\TeX\ looks ahead for as many consecutive letters $c_1\ldots c_n$ as
possible; however, |n| must be less than 64, so a character that would
otherwise be $c_{64}$ is effectively not a letter. Furthermore $c_n$ must
not be in the middle of a ligature.  In this way we obtain a string of
letters $c_1\ldots c_n$ that are generated by nodes $p_a\ldots p_b$, where
|1 <= a <= b+1 <= m|. If |n >= l_hyf+r_hyf|, this string qualifies for hyphenation;
however, |uc_hyph| must be positive, if $c_1$ is uppercase.

The hyphenation process takes place in three stages. First, the candidate
sequence $c_1\ldots c_n$ is found; then potential positions for hyphens
are determined by referring to hyphenation tables; and finally, the nodes
$p_a\ldots p_b$ are replaced by a new sequence of nodes that includes the
discretionary breaks found.

Fortunately, we do not have to do all this calculation very often, because
of the way it has been taken out of \TeX's inner loop. For example, when
the second edition of the author's 700-page book {\sl Seminumerical
Algorithms} was typeset by \TeX, only about 1.2 hyphenations needed to be
@^Knuth, Donald Ervin@>
tried per paragraph, since the line breaking algorithm needed to use two
passes on only about 5 per cent of the paragraphs.

at \TeX's hyphenation procedure, which is independent of the rest of the

comparatively little chance of being hyphenated. If no hyphens have

preceding character in |hu[0]| and by storing a possible right boundary

@ We must now face the fact that the battle is not over, even though the
{\def\!{\kern-1pt}%
hyphens have been found: The process of reconstituting a word can be nontrivial
because ligatures might change when a hyphen is present. {\sl The \TeX book\/}
discusses the difficulties of the word ``difficult'', and
the discretionary material surrounding a
hyphen can be considerably more complex than that. Suppose
\.{abcdef} is a word in a font for which the only ligatures are \.{b\!c},
\.{c\!d}, \.{d\!e}, and \.{e\!f}. If this word permits hyphenation
between \.b and \.c, the two patterns with and without hyphenation are
$\.a\,\.b\,\.-\,\.{c\!d}\,\.{e\!f}$ and $\.a\,\.{b\!c}\,\.{d\!e}\,\.f$.
Thus the insertion of a hyphen might cause effects to ripple arbitrarily
far into the rest of the word. A further complication arises if additional
hyphens appear together with such rippling, e.g., if the word in the
example just given could also be hyphenated between \.c and \.d; \TeX\
avoids this by simply ignoring the additional hyphens in such weird cases.}

Still further complications arise in the presence of ligatures that do not
delete the original characters. When punctuation precedes the word being
hyphenated, \TeX's method is not perfect under all possible scenarios,
because punctuation marks and letters can propagate information back and forth.
For example, suppose the original pre-hyphenation pair
\.{*a} changes to \.{*y} via a \.{\?=:} ligature, which changes to \.{xy}
via a \.{=:\?} ligature; if $p_{a-1}=\.x$ and $p_a=\.y$, the reconstitution
procedure isn't smart enough to obtain \.{xy} again. In such cases the
font designer should include a ligature that goes from \.{xa} to \.{xy}.

@ The processing is facilitated by a subroutine called |reconstitute|. Given
a string of characters $x_j\ldots x_n$, there is a smallest index $m\ge j$
such that the ``translation'' of $x_j\ldots x_n$ by ligatures and kerning
has the form $y_1\ldots y_t$ followed by the translation of $x_{m+1}\ldots x_n$,
where $y_1\ldots y_t$ is some nonempty sequence of character, ligature, and
kern nodes. We call $x_j\ldots x_m$ a ``cut prefix'' of $x_j\ldots x_n$.
For example, if $x_1x_2x_3=\.{fly}$, and if the font contains `fl' as a
ligature and a kern between `fl' and `y', then $m=2$, $t=2$, and $y_1$ will
be a ligature node for `fl' followed by an appropriate kern node~$y_2$.
In the most common case, $x_j$~forms no ligature with $x_{j+1}$ and we
simply have $m=j$, $y_1=x_j$. If $m<n$ we can repeat the procedure on
$x_{m+1}\ldots x_n$ until the entire translation has been found.

The |reconstitute| function returns the integer $m$ and puts the nodes
$y_1\ldots y_t$ into a linked list starting at |link(hold_head)|,
getting the input $x_j\ldots x_n$ from the |hu| array. If $x_j=256$,
we consider $x_j$ to be an implicit left boundary character; in this
case |j| must be strictly less than~|n|. There is a
parameter |bchar|, which is either 256 or an implicit right boundary character
assumed to be present just following~$x_n$. (The value |hu[n+1]| is never
explicitly examined, but the algorithm imagines that |bchar| is there.)

If there exists an index |k| in the range $j\le k\le m$ such that |hyf[k]|
is odd and such that the result of |reconstitute| would have been different
if $x_{k+1}$ had been |hchar|, then |reconstitute| sets |hyphen_passed|
to the smallest such~|k|. Otherwise it sets |hyphen_passed| to zero.

A special convention is used in the case |j==0|: Then we assume that the
translation of |hu[0]| appears in a special list of charnodes starting at
|init_list|; moreover, if |init_lig| is |true|, then |hu[0]| will be
a ligature character, involving a left boundary if |init_lft| is |true|.
This facility is provided for cases when a hyphenated
word is preceded by punctuation (like single or double quotes) that might
affect the translation of the beginning of the word.

@* Hyphenation.
When a word |hc[1 dotdot hn]| has been set up to contain a candidate for hyphenation,
\TeX\ first looks to see if it is in the user's exception dictionary. If not,
hyphens are inserted based on patterns that appear within the given word,
using an algorithm due to Frank~M. Liang.
@^Liang, Franklin Mark@>

Let's consider Liang's method first, since it is much more interesting than the
exception-lookup routine.  The algorithm begins by setting |hyf[j]| to zero
for all |j|, and invalid characters are inserted into |hc[0]|
and |hc[hn+1]| to serve as delimiters. Then a reasonably fast method is
used to see which of a given set of patterns occurs in the word
|hc[0 dotdot(hn+1)]|. Each pattern $p_1\ldots p_k$ of length |k| has an associated
sequence of |k+1| numbers $n_0\ldots n_k$; and if the pattern occurs in
|hc[(j+1)dotdot(j+k)]|, \TeX\ will set |hyf[j+i]=@tmax@>(hyf[j+i],@t$n_i$@>)| for
|0 <= i <= k|. After this has been done for each pattern that occurs, a
discretionary hyphen will be inserted between |hc[j]| and |hc[j+1]| when
|hyf[j]| is odd, as we have already seen.

The set of patterns $p_1\ldots p_k$ and associated numbers $n_0\ldots n_k$
depends, of course, on the language whose words are being hyphenated, and
on the degree of hyphenation that is desired. A method for finding
appropriate |p|'s and |n|'s, from a given dictionary of words and acceptable
hyphenations, is discussed in Liang's Ph.D. thesis (Stanford University,
1983); \TeX\ simply starts with the patterns and works from there.

@ The patterns are stored in a compact table that is also efficient for
retrieval, using a variant of ``trie memory'' [cf.\ {\sl The Art of
Computer Programming \bf3} (1973), 481--505]. We can find each pattern
$p_1\ldots p_k$ by letting $z_0$ be one greater than the relevant language
index and then, for |1 <= i <= k|,
setting |@t$z_i$@>=trie_link@t$(z_{i-1})+p_i$@>|; the pattern will be
identified by the number $z_k$. Since all the pattern information is
packed together into a single |trie_link| array, it is necessary to
prevent confusion between the data from inequivalent patterns, so another
table is provided such that |trie_char@t$(z_i)=p_i$@>| for all |i|. There
is also a table |trie_op|$(z_k)$ to identify the numbers $n_0\ldots n_k$
associated with $p_1\ldots p_k$.

Comparatively few different number sequences $n_0\ldots n_k$ actually occur,
since most of the |n|'s are generally zero. Therefore the number sequences
are encoded in such a way that |trie_op|$(z_k)$ is only one byte long.
If |trie_op(@t$z_k$@>)!=min_quarterword|, when $p_1\ldots p_k$ has matched
the letters in |hc[(l-k+1)dotdot l@,]| of language |t|,
we perform all of the required operations
for this pattern by carrying out the following little program: Set
|v=trie_op(@t$z_k$@>)|. Then set |v=v+op_start[t]|,
|hyf[l-hyf_distance[v]]=@tmax@>(hyf[l-hyf_distance[v]], hyf_num[v])|,
and |v=hyf_next[v]|; repeat, if necessary, until |v==min_quarterword|.

@ The exception table that is built by \TeX's \.{\\hyphenation} primitive is
organized as an ordered hash table [cf.\ Amble and Knuth, {\sl The Computer
@^Amble, Ole@> @^Knuth, Donald Ervin@>
Journal\/ \bf17} (1974), 135--142] using linear probing. If $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ are words, we will say that $\alpha<\beta$ if $\vert\alpha\vert<
\vert\beta\vert$ or if $\vert\alpha\vert=\vert\beta\vert$ and
$\alpha$ is lexicographically smaller than $\beta$. (The notation $\vert
\alpha\vert$ stands for the length of $\alpha$.) The idea of ordered hashing
is to arrange the table so that a given word $\alpha$ can be sought by computing
a hash address $h=h(\alpha)$ and then looking in table positions |h|, |h-1|,
\dots, until encountering the first word $\L\alpha$. If this word is
different from $\alpha$, we can conclude that $\alpha$ is not in the table.

The words in the table point to lists in |mem| that specify hyphen positions
in their |info| fields. The list for $c_1\ldots c_n$ contains the number |k| if
the word $c_1\ldots c_n$ has a discretionary hyphen between $c_k$ and
$c_{k+1}$.

@* Initializing the hyphenation tables.
The trie for \TeX's hyphenation algorithm is built from a sequence of
patterns following a \.{\\patterns} specification. Such a specification
is allowed only in \.{INITEX}, since the extra memory for auxiliary tables
and for the initialization program itself would only clutter up the
production version of \TeX\ with a lot of deadwood.

The first step is to build a trie that is linked, instead of packed
into sequential storage, so that insertions are readily made.
After all patterns have been processed, \.{INITEX}
compresses the linked trie by identifying common subtries. Finally the
trie is packed into the efficient sequential form that the hyphenation
algorithm actually uses.

@ Before we discuss trie building in detail, let's consider the simpler
problem of creating the |hyf_distance|, |hyf_num|, and |hyf_next| arrays.

Suppose, for example, that \TeX\ reads the pattern `\.{ab2cde1}'. This is
a pattern of length 5, with $n_0\ldots n_5=0\,0\,2\,0\,0\,1$ in the
notation above. We want the corresponding |trie_op| code |v| to have
|hyf_distance[v]==3|, |hyf_num[v]==2|, and |hyf_next[v]==@t$v^\prime$@>|,
where the auxiliary |trie_op| code $v^\prime$ has
|hyf_distance[@t$v^\prime$@>]==0|, |hyf_num[@t$v^\prime$@>]==1|, and
|hyf_next[@t$v^\prime$@>]==min_quarterword|.

\TeX\ computes an appropriate value |v| with the |new_trie_op| subroutine
below, by setting
$$\hbox{|@t$v^\prime$@>=new_trie_op(0, 1, min_quarterword)|,\qquad
|v=new_trie_op(3, 2,@t$v^\prime$@>)|.}$$
This subroutine looks up its three
parameters in a special hash table, assigning a new value only if these
three have not appeared before for the current language.

The hash table is called |trie_op_hash|, and the number of entries it contains
is |trie_op_ptr|.

@ It's tempting to remove the |overflow| stops in the following procedure;
|new_trie_op| could return |min_quarterword| (thereby simply ignoring
part of a hyphenation pattern) instead of aborting the job. However, that would
lead to different hyphenation results on different installations of \TeX\
using the same patterns. The |overflow| stops are necessary for portability
of patterns.

@ The linked trie that is used to preprocess hyphenation patterns appears
in several global arrays. Each node represents an instruction of the form
``if you see character |c|, then perform operation |o|, move to the
next character, and go to node |l|; otherwise go to node |r|.''
The four quantities |c|, |o|, |l|, and |r| are stored in four arrays
|trie_c|, |trie_o|, |trie_l|, and |trie_r|. The root of the trie
is |trie_l[0]|, and the number of nodes is |trie_ptr|. Null trie
pointers are represented by zero. To initialize the trie, we simply
set |trie_l[0]| and |trie_ptr| to zero. We also set |trie_c[0]| to some
arbitrary value, since the algorithm may access it.

The algorithms maintain the condition
$$\hbox{|trie_c[trie_r[z]] > trie_c[z]|\qquad
whenever |z!=0| and |trie_r[z]!=0|};$$ in other words, sibling nodes are
ordered by their |c| fields.

@ Let us suppose that a linked trie has already been constructed.
Experience shows that we can often reduce its size by recognizing common
subtries; therefore another hash table is introduced for this purpose,
somewhat similar to |trie_op_hash|. The new hash table will be
initialized to zero.

The function |trie_node(p)| returns |p| if |p| is distinct from other nodes
that it has seen, otherwise it returns the number of the first equivalent
node that it has seen.

Notice that we might make subtries equivalent even if they correspond to
patterns for different languages, in which the trie ops might mean quite
different things. That's perfectly all right.

@ A neat recursive procedure is now able to compress a trie by
traversing it and applying |trie_node| to its nodes in ``bottom up''
fashion. We will compress the entire trie by clearing |trie_hash| to
zero and then saying `|trie_root=compress_trie(trie_root)|'.

@ The compressed trie will be packed into the |trie| array using a
``top-down first-fit'' procedure. This is a little tricky, so the reader
should pay close attention: The |trie_hash| array is cleared to zero
again and renamed |trie_ref| for this phase of the operation; later on,
|trie_ref[p]| will be nonzero only if the linked trie node |p| is the
smallest character
in a family and if the characters |c| of that family have been allocated to
locations |trie_ref[p]+c| in the |trie| array. Locations of |trie| that
are in use will have |trie_link==0|, while the unused holes in |trie|
will be doubly linked with |trie_link| pointing to the next larger vacant
location and |trie_back| pointing to the next smaller one. This double
linking will have been carried out only as far as |trie_max|, where
|trie_max| is the largest index of |trie| that will be needed.
To save time at the low end of the trie, we maintain array entries
|trie_min[c]| pointing to the smallest hole that is greater than~|c|.
Another array |trie_taken| tells whether or not a given location is
equal to |trie_ref[p]| for some |p|; this array is used to ensure that
distinct nodes in the compressed trie will have distinct |trie_ref|
entries.

@* Breaking vertical lists into pages.
The |vsplit| procedure, which implements \TeX's \.{\\vsplit} operation,
is considerably simpler than |line_break| because it doesn't have to
worry about hyphenation, and because its mission is to discover a single
break instead of an optimum sequence of breakpoints.  But before we get
into the details of |vsplit|, we need to consider a few more basic things.

@ A subroutine called |prune_page_top| takes a pointer to a vlist and
returns a pointer to a modified vlist in which all glue, kern, and penalty nodes
have been deleted before the first box or rule node. However, the first
box or rule is actually preceded by a newly created glue node designed so that
the topmost baseline will be at distance |split_top_skip| from the top,
whenever this is possible without backspacing.

In this routine and those that follow, we make use of the fact that a
vertical list contains no character nodes, hence the |type| field exists
for each node in the list.

if (width(temp_ptr) > height(p)) width(temp_ptr)=width(temp_ptr)-height(p);
else width(temp_ptr)=0;
p=null;
} 

@ The next subroutine finds the best place to break a given vertical list
so as to obtain a box of height~|h|, with maximum depth~|d|.
A pointer to the beginning of the vertical list is given,
and a pointer to the optimum breakpoint is returned. The list is effectively

if the best break occurs at this artificial node, the value |null| is returned.

from the beginning of the list to the current place, just as in |line_break|.

its new significance.

@ Now we are ready to consider |vsplit| itself. Most of
its work is accomplished by the two subroutines that we have just considered.

Given the number of a vlist box |n|, and given a desired page height |h|,
the |vsplit| function finds the best initial segment of the vlist and
returns a box for a page of height~|h|. The remainder of the vlist, if
any, replaces the original box, after removing glue and penalties and
adjusting for |split_top_skip|. Mark nodes in the split-off box are used to
set the values of |split_first_mark| and |split_bot_mark|; we use the
fact that |split_first_mark==null| if and only if |split_bot_mark==null|.

The original box becomes ``void'' if and only if it has been entirely
extracted.  The extracted box is ``void'' if and only if the original
box was void (or if it was, erroneously, an hlist box).

@* The page builder.
When \TeX\ appends new material to its main vlist in vertical mode, it uses
a method something like |vsplit| to decide where a page ends, except that
the calculations are done ``on line'' as new items come in.
The main complication in this process is that insertions must be put
into their boxes and removed from the vlist, in a more-or-less optimum manner.

We shall use the term ``current page'' for that part of the main vlist that
is being considered as a candidate for being broken off and sent to the
user's output routine. The current page starts at |link(page_head)|, and
it ends at |page_tail|.  We have |page_head==page_tail| if this list is empty.
@^current page@>

Utter chaos would reign if the user kept changing page specifications
while a page is being constructed, so the page builder keeps the pertinent
specifications frozen as soon as the page receives its first box or
insertion.  The global variable |page_contents| is |empty| when the
current page contains only mark nodes and content-less whatsit nodes; it
is |inserts_only| if the page contains only insertion nodes in addition to
marks and whatsits.  Glue nodes, kern nodes, and penalty nodes are
discarded until a box or rule node appears, at which time |page_contents|
changes to |box_there|.  As soon as |page_contents| becomes non-|empty|,
the current |vsize| and |max_depth| are squirreled away into |page_goal|
and |page_max_depth|; the latter values will be used until the page has
been forwarded to the user's output routine. The \.{\\topskip} adjustment
is made when |page_contents| changes to |box_there|.

Although |page_goal| starts out equal to |vsize|, it is decreased by the
scaled natural height-plus-depth of the insertions considered so far, and by
the \.{\\skip} corrections for those insertions. Therefore it represents
the size into which the non-inserted material should fit, assuming that
all insertions in the current page have been made.

The global variables |best_page_break| and |least_page_cost| correspond
respectively to the local variables |best_place| and |least_cost| in the
|vert_break| routine that we have already studied; i.e., they record the
location and value of the best place currently known for breaking the
current page. The value of |page_goal| at the time of the best break is
stored in |best_size|.

@d inserts_only	1
   /*|page_contents| when an insert node has been contributed, but no boxes*/

pointer @!best_page_break; /*break here to get the best page known so far*/ 
int @!least_page_cost; /*the score for this currently best page*/ 
scaled @!best_size; /*its |page_goal|*/ 

@ The page builder has another data structure to keep track of insertions.
This is a list of four-word nodes, starting and ending at |page_ins_head|.
That is, the first element of the list is node |r@t$_1$@>==link(page_ins_head)|;
node $r_j$ is followed by |r@t$_{j+1}$@>==link(r@t$_j$@>)|; and if there are
|n| items we have |r@t$_{n+1}$@>==page_ins_head|. The |subtype| field of
each node in this list refers to an insertion number; for example, `\.{\\insert
250}' would correspond to a node whose |subtype| is |qi(250)|
(the same as the |subtype| field of the relevant |ins_node|). These |subtype|
fields are in increasing order, and |subtype(page_ins_head)==
qi(255)|, so |page_ins_head| serves as a convenient sentinel
at the end of the list. A record is present for each insertion number that
appears in the current page.

The |type| field in these nodes distinguishes two possibilities that
might occur as we look ahead before deciding on the optimum page break.
If |type(r)==inserting|, then |height(r)| contains the total of the
height-plus-depth dimensions of the box and all its inserts seen so far.
If |type(r)==split_up|, then no more insertions will be made into this box,
because at least one previous insertion was too big to fit on the current
page; |broken_ptr(r)| points to the node where that insertion will be
split, if \TeX\ decides to split it, |broken_ins(r)| points to the
insertion node that was tentatively split, and |height(r)| includes also the
natural height plus depth of the part that would be split off.

In both cases, |last_ins_ptr(r)| points to the last |ins_node|
encountered for box |qo(subtype(r))| that would be at least partially
inserted on the next page; and |best_ins_ptr(r)| points to the last
such |ins_node| that should actually be inserted, to get the page with
minimum badness among all page breaks considered so far. We have
|best_ins_ptr(r)==null| if and only if no insertion for this box should
be made to produce this optimum page.

The data structure definitions here use the fact that the |@!height| field
appears in the fourth word of a box node.

@ An array |page_so_far| records the heights and depths of everything
on the current page. This array contains six |scaled| numbers, like the
similar arrays already considered in |line_break| and |vert_break|; and it
also contains |page_goal| and |page_depth|, since these values are
all accessible to the user via |set_page_dimen| commands. The
value of |page_so_far[1]| is also called |page_total|.  The stretch
and shrink components of the \.{\\skip} corrections for each insertion are
included in |page_so_far|, but the natural space components of these
corrections are not, since they have been subtracted from |page_goal|.

The variable |page_depth| records the depth of the current page; it has been
adjusted so that it is at most |page_max_depth|. The variable
|last_glue| points to the glue specification of the most recent node
contributed from the contribution list, if this was a glue node; otherwise
|last_glue==max_halfword|. (If the contribution list is nonempty,
however, the value of |last_glue| is not necessarily accurate.)
The variables |last_penalty| and |last_kern| are similar.  And
finally, |insert_penalties| holds the sum of the penalties associated with
all split and floating insertions.

@ Pages are built by appending nodes to the current list in \TeX's
vertical mode, which is at the outermost level of the semantic nest. This
vlist is split into two parts; the ``current page'' that we have been
talking so much about already, and the ``contribution list'' that receives
new nodes as they are created.  The current page contains everything that
the page builder has accounted for in its data structures, as described
above, while the contribution list contains other things that have been
generated by other parts of \TeX\ but have not yet been
seen by the page builder.
The contribution list starts at |link(contrib_head)|, and it ends at the
current node in \TeX's vertical mode.

When \TeX\ has appended new material in vertical mode, it calls the procedure
|build_page|, which tries to catch up by moving nodes from the contribution
list to the current page. This procedure will succeed in its goal of
emptying the contribution list, unless a page break is discovered, i.e.,
unless the current page has grown to the point where the optimum next
page break has been determined. In the latter case, the nodes after the
optimum break will go back onto the contribution list, and control will
effectively pass to the user's output routine.

We make |type(page_head)==glue_node|, so that an initial glue node on
the current page will not be considered a valid breakpoint.

@ When the page builder has looked at as much material as could appear before
the next page break, it makes its decision. The break that gave minimum
badness will be used to put a completed ``page'' into box 255, with insertions
appended to their other boxes.

We also set the values of |top_mark|, |first_mark|, and |bot_mark|. The
program uses the fact that |bot_mark!=null| implies |first_mark!=null|;
it also knows that |bot_mark==null| implies |top_mark==first_mark==null|.

The |fire_up| subroutine prepares to output the current page at the best
place; then it fires up the user's output routine, if there is one,
or it simply ships out the page. There is one parameter, |c|, which represents
the node that was being contributed to the page when the decision to

@* The chief executive.
We come now to the |main_control| routine, which contains the master
switch that causes all the various pieces of \TeX\ to do their things,
in the right order.

In a sense, this is the grand climax of the program: It applies all the
tools that we have worked so hard to construct. In another sense, this is
the messiest part of the program: It necessarily refers to other pieces
of code all over the place, so that a person can't fully understand what is
going on without paging back and forth to be reminded of conventions that
are defined elsewhere. We are now at the hub of the web, the central nervous
system that touches most of the other parts and ties them together.

The structure of |main_control| itself is quite simple. There's a label
called |big_switch|, at which point the next token of input is fetched
using |get_x_token|. Then the program branches at high speed into one of
about 100 possible directions, based on the value of the current
mode and the newly fetched command code; the sum |abs(mode)+cur_cmd|
indicates what to do next. For example, the case `|vmode+letter|' arises
when a letter occurs in vertical mode (or internal vertical mode); this
case leads to instructions that initialize a new paragraph and enter
horizontal mode.

The big |case| statement that contains this multiway switch has been labeled
|reswitch|, so that the program can |goto reswitch| when the next token
has already been fetched. Most of the cases are quite short; they call
an ``action procedure'' that does the work for that case, and then they
either |goto reswitch| or they ``fall through'' to the end of the |case|
statement, which returns control back to |big_switch|. Thus, |main_control|
is not an extremely large procedure, in spite of the multiplicity of things
it must do; it is small enough to be handled by \PASCAL\ compilers that put
severe restrictions on procedure size.
@!@^action procedure@>

One case is singled out for special treatment, because it accounts for most
of \TeX's activities in typical applications. The process of reading simple
text and converting it into |char_node| records, while looking for ligatures
and kerns, is part of \TeX's ``inner loop''; the whole program runs
efficiently when its inner loop is fast, so this part has been written
with particular care.

@ We shall concentrate first on the inner loop of |main_control|, deferring
consideration of the other cases until later.

@ The following part of the program was first written in a structured
manner, according to the philosophy that ``premature optimization is
the root of all evil.'' Then it was rearranged into pieces of
spaghetti so that the most common actions could proceed with little or
no redundancy.

The original unoptimized form of this algorithm resembles the
|reconstitute| procedure, which was described earlier in connection with
hyphenation. Again we have an implied ``cursor'' between characters
|cur_l| and |cur_r|. The main difference is that the |lig_stack| can now
contain a charnode as well as pseudo-ligatures; that stack is now
usually nonempty, because the next character of input (if any) has been
appended to it. In |main_control| we have
$$|cur_r|=\cases{|character(lig_stack)|,&if |lig_stack > null|;\cr
  |font_bchar[cur_font]|,&otherwise;\cr}$$
except when |character(lig_stack)==font_false_bchar[cur_font]|.

case is |sf_code(cur_chr)==1000|, so we want that case to be fast.

The most important parts of |main_control| are concerned with \TeX's
chief mission of box-making. We need to control the activities that put
entries on vlists and hlists, as well as the activities that convert
those lists into boxes. All of the necessary machinery has already been
developed; it remains for us to ``push the buttons'' at the right times.

@ As an introduction to these routines, let's consider one of the simplest
cases: What happens when `\.{\\hrule}' occurs in vertical mode, or
`\.{\\vrule}' in horizontal mode or math mode? The code in |main_control|
is short, since the |scan_rule_spec| routine already does most of what is
required; thus, there is no need for a special action procedure.

Note that baselineskip calculations are disabled after a rule in vertical
mode, by setting |prev_depth=ignore_depth|.

@ Many of the actions related to box-making are triggered by the appearance
of braces in the input. For example, when the user says `\.{\\hbox}
\.{to} \.{100pt\{$\langle\,\hbox{hlist}\,\rangle$\}}' in vertical mode,
the information about the box size (100pt, |exactly|) is put onto |save_stack|
with a level boundary word just above it, and |cur_group=adjusted_hbox_group|;
\TeX\ enters restricted horizontal mode to process the hlist. The right
brace eventually causes |save_stack| to be restored to its former state,
at which time the information about the box size (100pt, |exactly|) is
available once again; a box is packaged and we leave restricted horizontal
mode, appending the new box to the current list of the enclosing mode
(in this case to the current list of vertical mode), followed by any
vertical adjustments that were removed from the box by |hpack|.

The next few sections of the program are therefore concerned with the
treatment of left and right curly braces.

@ If a left brace occurs in the middle of a page or paragraph, it simply
introduces a new level of grouping, and the matching right brace will not have
such a drastic effect. Such grouping affects neither the mode nor the
current list.

@ We have to deal with errors in which braces and such things are not
properly nested. Sometimes the user makes an error of commission by
inserting an extra symbol, but sometimes the user makes an error of omission.
\TeX\ can't always tell one from the other, so it makes a guess and tries
to avoid getting into a loop.

to insert something into the user's input that will help clean off

@ Now let's turn to the question of how \.{\\hbox} is treated. We actually
need to consider also a slightly larger context, since constructions like
`\.{\\setbox3=}\penalty0\.{\\hbox...}' and
`\.{\\leaders}\penalty0\.{\\hbox...}' and
`\.{\\lower3.8pt\\hbox...}'
are supposed to invoke quite
different actions after the box has been packaged. Conversely,
constructions like `\.{\\setbox3=}' can be followed by a variety of
different kinds of boxes, and we would like to encode such things in an
efficient way.

In other words, there are two problems: to represent the context of a box,
and to represent its type.

The first problem is solved by putting a ``context code'' on the |save_stack|,
just below the two entries that give the dimensions produced by |scan_spec|.
The context code is either a (signed) shift amount, or it is a large
integer | >= box_flag|, where |box_flag==@t$2^{30}$@>|. Codes |box_flag| through
|box_flag+255| represent `\.{\\setbox0}' through `\.{\\setbox255}';
codes |box_flag+256| through |box_flag+511| represent `\.{\\global\\setbox0}'
through `\.{\\global\\setbox255}';
code |box_flag+512| represents `\.{\\shipout}'; and codes |box_flag+513|
through |box_flag+515| represent `\.{\\leaders}', `\.{\\cleaders}',
and `\.{\\xleaders}'.

The second problem is solved by giving the command code |make_box| to all
control sequences that produce a box, and by using the following |chr_code|
values to distinguish between them: |box_code|, |copy_code|, |last_box_code|,
|vsplit_code|, |vtop_code|, |vtop_code+vmode|, and |vtop_code+hmode|, where
the latter two are used to denote \.{\\vbox} and \.{\\hbox}, respectively.

@* Building math lists.
The routines that \TeX\ uses to create mlists are similar to those we have
just seen for the generation of hlists and vlists. But it is necessary to
make ``noads'' as well as nodes, so the reader should review the
discussion of math mode data structures before trying to make sense out of
the following program.

Here is a little routine that needs to be done whenever a subformula
is about to be processed. The parameter is a code like |math_group|.

@ Subformulas of math formulas cause a new level of math mode to be entered,
on the semantic nest as well as the save stack. These subformulas arise in
several ways: (1)~A left brace by itself indicates the beginning of a
subformula that will be put into a box, thereby freezing its glue and
preventing line breaks. (2)~A subscript or superscript is treated as a
subformula if it is not a single character; the same applies to
the nucleus of things like \.{\\underline}. (3)~The \.{\\left} primitive
initiates a subformula that will be terminated by a matching \.{\\right}.
The group codes placed on |save_stack| in these three cases are
|math_group|, |math_group|, and |math_left_group|, respectively.

Here is the code that handles case (1); the other cases are not quite as
trivial, so we shall consider them later.

broken down into subfields called |math_type| and either |info| or

in one of these principal fields; it looks at the subformula that
comes next in the input, and places an encoding of that subformula
into a given word of |mem|.

@* Mode-independent processing.
The long |main_control| procedure has now been fully specified, except for
certain activities that are independent of the current mode. These activities
do not change the current vlist or hlist or mlist; if they change anything,
it is the value of a parameter or the meaning of a control sequence.

Assignments to values in |eqtb| can be global or local. Furthermore, a
control sequence can be defined to be `\.{\\long}' or `\.{\\outer}', and
it might or might not be expanded. The prefixes `\.{\\global}', `\.{\\long}',
and `\.{\\outer}' can occur in any order. Therefore we assign binary numeric
codes, making it possible to accumulate the union of all specified prefixes
by adding the corresponding codes.  (\PASCAL's |set| operations could also
have been used.)

@* Dumping and undumping the tables.
After \.{INITEX} has seen a collection of fonts and macros, it
can write all the necessary information on an auxiliary file so
that production versions of \TeX\ are able to initialize their
memory at high speed. The present section of the program takes

the processes of storing and restoring,
so that the inverse relation between them is clear.

string says simply `\.{(INITEX)}'; for other versions of \TeX\ it says,
for example, `\.{(preloaded format=plain 1982.11.19)}', showing the year,
month, and day that the format file was created. We have |format_ident==0|

@* The main program.
This is it: the part of \TeX\ that executes all those procedures we have
written.

Well---almost. Let's leave space for a few more routines that we may
have forgotten.

@p@<Last-minute procedures@>@;

@ We have noted that there are two versions of \TeX82. One, called \.{INITEX},
@.INITEX@>
has to be run first; it initializes everything from scratch, without
reading a format file, and it has the capability of dumping a format file.
The other one is called `\.{VIRTEX}'; it is a ``virgin'' program that needs
@.VIRTEX@>
to input a format file in order to get started. \.{VIRTEX} typically has
more memory capacity than \.{INITEX}, because it does not need the space
consumed by the auxiliary hyphenation tables and the numerous calls on
|primitive|, etc.

The \.{VIRTEX} program cannot read a format file instantaneously, of course;
the best implementations therefore allow for production versions of \TeX\ that
not only avoid the loading routine for \PASCAL\ object code, they also have
a format file pre-loaded. This is impossible to do if we stick to standard
\PASCAL; but there is a simple way to fool many systems into avoiding the
initialization, as follows:\quad(1)~We declare a global integer variable
called |ready_already|. The probability is negligible that this
variable holds any particular value like 314159 when \.{VIRTEX} is first
loaded.\quad(2)~After we have read in a format file and initialized
everything, we set |ready_already=314159|.\quad(3)~Soon \.{VIRTEX}
will print `\.*', waiting for more input; and at this point we
interrupt the program and save its core image in some form that the
operating system can reload speedily.\quad(4)~When that core image is
activated, the program starts again at the beginning; but now
|ready_already==314159| and all the other global variables have
their initial values too. The former chastity has vanished!

In other words, if we allow ourselves to test the condition
|ready_already==314159|, before |ready_already| has been
assigned a value, we can avoid the lengthy initialization. Dirty tricks
rarely pay off so handsomely.
@^dirty \PASCAL@>
@^system dependencies@>

On systems that allow such preloading, the standard program called \.{TeX}
should be the one that has \.{plain} format preloaded, since that agrees
with {\sl The \TeX book}. Other versions, e.g., \.{AmSTeX}, should also
@:TeXbook}{\sl The \TeX book@>
@.AmSTeX@>
@.plain@>
be provided for commonly used formats.

@<Glob...@>=
int @!ready_already; /*a sacrifice of purity for economy*/ 

@ Now this is really it: \TeX\ starts and ends here.

The initial test involving |ready_already| should be deleted if the
\PASCAL\ runtime system is smart enough to detect such a ``mistake.''

@ Here we do whatever is needed to complete \TeX's job gracefully on the
local operating system. The code here might come into play after a fatal
error; it must therefore consist entirely of ``safe'' operations that
cannot produce error messages. For example, it would be a mistake to call
|str_room| or |make_string| at this time, because a call on |overflow|
might lead to an infinite loop.

@* Debugging.
Once \TeX\ is working, you should be able to diagnose most errors with
the \.{\\show} commands and other diagnostic features. But for the initial
stages of debugging, and for the revelation of really deep mysteries, you
can compile \TeX\ with a few more aids, including the \PASCAL\ runtime
checks and its debugger. An additional routine called |debug_help|
will also come into play when you type `\.D' after an error message;
|debug_help| also occurs just before a fatal error causes \TeX\ to succumb.
@^debugging@>
@^system dependencies@>

The interface to |debug_help| is primitive, but it is good enough when used
with a \PASCAL\ debugger that allows you to set breakpoints and to read
variables and change their values. After getting the prompt `\.{debug \#}', you
type either a negative number (this exits |debug_help|), or zero (this
goes to a location where you can set a breakpoint, thereby entering into
dialog with the \PASCAL\ debugger), or a positive number |m| followed by
an argument |n|. The meaning of |m| and |n| will be clear from the
program below. (If |m==13|, there is an additional argument, |l|.)

@* Extensions.
The program above includes a bunch of ``hooks'' that allow further
capabilities to be added without upsetting \TeX's basic structure.
Most of these hooks are concerned with ``whatsit'' nodes, which are
intended to be used for special purposes; whenever a new extension to
\TeX\ involves a new kind of whatsit node, a corresponding change needs
to be made to the routines below that deal with such nodes,
but it will usually be unnecessary to make many changes to the
other parts of this program.

In order to demonstrate how extensions can be made, we shall treat
`\.{\\write}', `\.{\\openout}', `\.{\\closeout}', `\.{\\immediate}',
`\.{\\special}', and `\.{\\setlanguage}' as if they were extensions.
These commands are actually primitives of \TeX, and they should
appear in all implementations of the system; but let's try to imagine
that they aren't. Then the program below illustrates how a person
could add them.

Sometimes, of course, an extension will require changes to \TeX\ itself;
no system of hooks could be complete enough for all conceivable extensions.
The features associated with `\.{\\write}' are almost all confined to the
following paragraphs, but there are small parts of the |print_ln| and
|print_char| procedures that were introduced specifically to \.{\\write}
characters. Furthermore one of the token lists recognized by the scanner
is a |write_text|; and there are a few other miscellaneous places where we
have already provided for some aspect of \.{\\write}.  The goal of a \TeX\
extender should be to minimize alterations to the standard parts of the
program, and to avoid them completely if possible. He or she should also
be quite sure that there's no easy way to accomplish the desired goals
with the standard features that \TeX\ already has. ``Think thrice before
extending,'' because that may save a lot of work, and it will also keep
incompatible extensions of \TeX\ from proliferating.
@^system dependencies@>
@^extensions to \TeX@>

@ First let's consider the format of whatsit nodes that are used to represent
the data associated with \.{\\write} and its relatives. Recall that a whatsit
has |type==whatsit_node|, and the |subtype| is supposed to distinguish
different kinds of whatsits. Each node occupies two or more words; the
exact number is immaterial, as long as it is readily determined from the
|subtype| or other data.

We shall introduce five |subtype| values here, corresponding to the
control sequences \.{\\openout}, \.{\\write}, \.{\\closeout}, \.{\\special}, and
\.{\\setlanguage}. The second word of I/O whatsits has a |write_stream| field
that identifies the write-stream number (0 to 15, or 16 for out-of-range and
positive, or 17 for out-of-range and negative).
In the case of \.{\\write} and \.{\\special}, there is also a field that
points to the reference count of a token list that should be sent. In the
case of \.{\\openout}, we need three words and three auxiliary subfields
to hold the string numbers for name, area, and extension.

@d write_node_size	2 /*number of words in a write/whatsit node*/ 
@d open_node_size	3 /*number of words in an open/whatsit node*/ 
@d open_node	0 /*|subtype| in whatsits that represent files to \.{\\openout}*/ 
@d write_node	1 /*|subtype| in whatsits that represent things to \.{\\write}*/ 
@d close_node	2 /*|subtype| in whatsits that represent streams to \.{\\closeout}*/ 
@d special_node	3 /*|subtype| in whatsits that represent \.{\\special} things*/ 
@d language_node	4 /*|subtype| in whatsits that change the current language*/ 
@d what_lang(X)	link(X+1) /*language number, in the range |0 dotdot 255|*/ 
@d what_lhm(X)	type(X+1) /*minimum left fragment, in the range |1 dotdot 63|*/ 
@d what_rhm(X)	subtype(X+1) /*minimum right fragment, in the range |1 dotdot 63|*/ 
@d write_tokens(X)	link(X+1) /*reference count of token list to write*/ 
@d write_stream(X)	info(X+1) /*stream number (0 to 17)*/ 
@d open_name(X)	link(X+1) /*string number of file name to open*/ 
@d open_area(X)	info(X+2) /*string number of file area for |open_name|*/ 
@d open_ext(X)	link(X+2) /*string number of file extension for |open_name|*/ 

@ The sixteen possible \.{\\write} streams are represented by the |write_file|
array. The |j|th file is open if and only if |write_open[j]==true|. The last
two streams are special; |write_open[16]| represents a stream number
greater than 15, while |write_open[17]| represents a negative stream number,
and both of these variables are always |false|.

It is usually best to design your change file so that all changes to

@* Index.
Here is where you can find all uses of each identifier in the program,
with underlined entries pointing to where the identifier was defined.
If the identifier is only one letter long, however, you get to see only
the underlined entries. {\sl All references are to section numbers instead of
page numbers.}

This index also lists error messages and other aspects of the program
that you might want to look up some day. For example, the entry
for ``system dependencies'' lists all sections that should receive
special attention from people who are installing \TeX\ in a new
operating environment. A list of various things that can't happen appears
under ``this can't happen''. Approximately 40 sections are listed under
``inner loop''; these account for about 60\pct! of \TeX's running time,
exclusive of input and output.
